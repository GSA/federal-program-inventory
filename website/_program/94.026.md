objective: To further achieve its mission, AmeriCorps has a strong belief in the importance
  of research in order to identify effective strategies for national service and increase
  the evidence-base for its programs. This means engaging the broader community of
  academic researchers involved in studying and evaluating national service, volunteerism,
  and civic infrastructure. The goal of this competition is to increase the nation’s
  understanding and knowledge about the importance and potential of volunteering,
  national and community service, and/or civic engagement in America.  We are seeking
  applications that build on existing research in the field, address gaps in knowledge,
  and provide new ideas and methodological approaches to the study of national service.
