This program also provides for the construction and improvement of highways in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n\n2) The Federal Lands Highway Program: The Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) aids the Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) for Federally owned roads and trails. It provides transportation engineering services and funding for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges that are on or provide access to federally owned lands.  The Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) provides safe and adequate transportation and public road access to and within tribal communities. The Federal Lands Highway organization also provides training, technology deployment, and engineering services to other customers. \n\n3) The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs (IIJA) Act is a once-in-a-generation investment in our infrastructure that will help grow the economy, enhance U.S. competitiveness, create good jobs, and build our safe and resilient transportation future. IIJA provides the basis for FHWA programs and activities through September 30, 2026. It makes an investment of $350 billion in highway programs. This includes the largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the Interstate Highway System. New programs under the IIJA focus on key infrastructure priorities including rehabilitating bridges in critical need of repair, increasing system resilience, removing barriers to connecting communities, and improving mobility and access to economic opportunity. Many of the new programs include eligibility for local governments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Tribes, and other public authorities, allowing them to compete directly for funding. IIJA also continues to focus the program on safety and performance-based investment and on accelerating project delivery through expedited environmental review and elimination of duplicate processes. \n\n4) The Highway Infrastructure Programs in the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2018, included two new competitive programs: Competitive Bridge Program and Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program. The Competitive Bridge Program was appropriated $225 million to be used for highway bridge rehabilitation or replacement projects for States that have a population density of less than 100 individuals per square mile and that demonstrate cost savings by bundling multiple highway bridge projects.","gwo":"Sustain Public Roadway System","pons":"Construct New Community Infrastructure,Maintain Existing Community Infrastructure,Repair Existing Community Infrastructure","popularName":"Federal-Aid Highway Program,  Federal Lands Highway Program","agency":{"title":"Department of Transportation","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)"}},"assistanceTypes":["Salaries and Expenses"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[{"title":"Transportation","subCategory":{"title":"Ground Transportation"}}]},{"cfda":"TC.065","title":"Capital gains exclusion on home sales","permalink":"/program/TC.065","obligations":59070000000.0,"objectives":"The baseline tax system would not allow deductions and exemptions for certain types of income.

Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual, participants are able to find their own housing, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. The program serves the most economically vulnerable families in the country, including families with disabilities, elderly families, formerly homeless veterans, and families with children, through federal assistance voucher payments in the provision of meeting their rental housing needs. HUD regulations merged the former Section 8 Rental Voucher program (14.855) with the former Section 8 Certificate program (14.857). Section 502 of the Public Housing Reform Act states that a purpose of the legislation is \"consolidating the voucher and certificate programs for rental assistance under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the \"USHA\") into a single market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families\". The HCVP is administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized under State law to operate housing programs within an area or jurisdiction. The PHAs receive federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to administer the voucher program. The PHA accepts a family\u2019s application for rental assistance, selects the applicant family for admission, and issues the selected family a voucher confirming the family\u2019s eligibility for assistance. The family must then find and lease a dwelling unit suitable to the family\u2019s needs and desires in the private rental market. The PHAs sign Housing Assistant Payment contracts with the landlords, and housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances, if authorized by the PHA, a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":null,"agency":{"title":"Department of Housing and Urban Development","subAgency":{"title":"Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing"}},"assistanceTypes":["Interstate"],"applicantTypes":["Other private institutions/organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"97.036","title":"Disaster Grants - Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters)","permalink":"/program/97.036","obligations":30398971240.0,"objectives":"To assist state, local, territorial , and tribal (SLTT) governments and eligible private non-profits in responding to and recovering from the devastating effects of disasters by providing assistance for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and the repair, restoration, reconstruction or replacement of public and eligible private non-profit facilities or infrastructure damaged or destroyed as the result of Presidentially-declared major disasters or emergencies.Performance Measures:\nDebris Grants:\n\u2022\tNumber awarded for debris removal\n\u2022\tNumber of debris subawards obligated\n\u2022\t80% of debris subawards developed without rework, as a result of effective training and processes\n\u2022\t75% of debris subawards obligation within PA PDG guidelines\n\u2022\t90% of debris projects completed within the POP\nEmergency Protective Measure Grants\n\u2022\tDollar amount awarded for Emergency Protective Measures\n\u2022\tNumber of EPM subawards obligated\n\u2022\t80% of EPM subawards developed without rework, as a result of \n\u2022\teffective training and processes\n\u2022\t75% of EPM subawards obligated within PDG guidelines\n\u2022\t90% of EPM projects completed within the POP\nResilience Infrastructure Grants\n\u2022\tDollar amount awarded for infrastructure projects\n\u2022\tNumber of infrastructure subawards obligated\n\u2022\t25% of total infrastructure dollars are obligated for mitigation to improve resiliency of FEMA funded projects\n\u2022\tPercent of infrastructure projects that include mitigation to improve resiliency of FEMA funded projects\n\u2022\t80% of infrastructure subawards developed without rework, as a result of effective training and processes\n\u2022\t75% of infrastructure subawards obligated within PA PDG guidelines\n\u2022\t90% of infrastructure projects completed within the POP\nGrant Management Funds\n\u2022\tDollar amount awarded for management cost\n\u2022\tNumber of management cost subawards obligated\n\u2022\t90% of management cost projects completed within the POP\n\u2022\t90% of closeouts submitted by recipients within PA PDG timelines\n\u2022\tPercent of Applicants with SVI scores above .7 assigned appropriate PDMGs\nTraining, Development, and Guidance\n\u2022\t75% of Applicant Coordination & Evaluation activities completed within 30 days of incident\n\u2022\tApplicants reporting satisfaction with FEMA policies, processes, and engagement: \no\tPA overall \u2013 90%; Understanding PA \u2013 80%; Grants Portal \u2013 90%\n\u2022\t20% of declared events are recipient led\n\u2022\t80% of FEMA PA staff assigned roles aligned w/ training and quals","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":null,"agency":{"title":"Department of Homeland Security","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Emergency Management Agency"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Government - General","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"TC.008","title":"Credit for increasing research activities","permalink":"/program/TC.008","obligations":30040000000.0,"objectives":"The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries.

The program is designed to involve parents in their child\u2019s learning and development, and to help parents make progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of their local Head Start programs.

These programs promote the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals, programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives of the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\nSince 2014 through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start programs or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  \n\nThe Office of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge, skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn, improve the outcomes of children and families.

The FAA Office of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute to these goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial Information. \n\nThe ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient national airports system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S., with considerations for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding the public investment. As an important component of that mission, ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity, efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection, and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including Executive Order 14005 \u2013 \u201cEnsuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America\u2019s Workers\u201d(as listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the FAA\u2019s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.","gwo":"Increase Aviation Safety","pons":"Improve Air Travel Safety ,Improve Job-Specific Skills","popularName":"AIP, IIJA, CARES and ARPA","agency":{"title":"Department of Transportation","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other public institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":[{"title":"Transportation","subCategory":{"title":"Air Transportation"}}]},{"cfda":"20.315","title":"National Railroad Passenger Corporation Grants","permalink":"/program/20.315","obligations":6726308186.0,"objectives":"To provide financial assistance to support the operation of and capital investment in intercity passenger rail service in the United States.","gwo":"Improve Rail Transportation Networks","pons":"Improve Transit Connectivity","popularName":"(Amtrak Grants)","agency":{"title":"Department of Transportation","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Profit organization"],"categories":[{"title":"Transportation","subCategory":{"title":"Ground Transportation"}}]},{"cfda":"TC.122","title":"Exclusion of employee meals and lodging (other than military)","permalink":"/program/TC.122","obligations":6690000000.0,"objectives":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income.

The purpose of the three formula grants funds is to help certain families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. The Mandatory and Matching funds are made available in section 418 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618) and are not subject to annual appropriations. \nThe first formula grant program is formula grants to States and DC. These include \nMandatory funds (which are 100% federal) and Matching funds (which require a State match and maintenance of effort).  Allocations of the Mandatory Funds are based on a State's Federal share of the expenditures for the now-repealed AFDC-linked child care programs (AFDC/JOBS Child Care, Transitional Child Care, and At-Risk Child Care) in 1994 or 1995, or the average of 1992 through 1994, whichever was greater. A State is not required to expend any State funds in order to receive its share of the Mandatory Funds. \nMatching funds are available to states if three conditions are met by the end of the fiscal year in which the funds are awarded: (1) all Mandatory funds are obligated; (2) the state\u2019s Maintenance-of-Effort funds are expended; and (3) the state provides its share of Matching funds at the FMAP rate. The Matching Funds are distributed based on the number of children under age 13 in a State compared with the national total of children under age 13.  \nThe second formula grant is Mandatory funds to territories, including American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.  Territory Mandatory funds are allotted based on the number of children under age five living in territories and per capita income in the territories. Territory Mandatory funds are not subject to any matching requirements. Each year, Territories receive $75 million in Mandatory funding. Territory Mandatory funds must be obligated in the fiscal year that they are awarded and liquidated in the following year; however, in certain circumstances, unobligated funds may be reobligated in subsequent fiscal years.  \n\nThe third formula grant is Mandatory funds to Tribal Lead Agencies. Tribal Mandatory funds are not subject to any matching requirements.  Each year, Tribal Lead Agencies receive $100 million in Tribal Mandatory funds. Mandatory funds to Tribes are allocated based on the number of children under the age of 13 in a Tribe\u2019s service area.

It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future. From Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 to FY 2019, FMA obligated over $1.5 billion in federal share mitigating over 8,000 properties insured by the National Flood Insurance Program. \n\nPerformance Measures\nThe following key performance indicators provide strategic and relevant information to decisionmakers and stakeholders about FMA\u2019s progress and success toward achieving goals and objectives, and are based on measurable data that are available or could be feasibly collected:\n\n\u2022\tTotal number of NFIP-insured properties selected that are FMA and/or NFIP defined Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), Repetitive Loss (RL), and Substantially Damaged.\n\u2022\tTotal federal cost share funding invested in Justice40 Communities identified using version 1.0 of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).\n\u2022\tTotal dollar amount of flood losses avoided in projects or communities funded by FMA subapplications.\nFEMA will further assess the recipient\u2019s performance against the program objective during the award closeout process as outlined in Section F.3.c of this funding opportunity. \n\nGoals\nThe FMA program aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the FMA program supports. FMA serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk through funding flood mitigation projects. The FMA program addresses Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience. FMA also supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy and the FIMA FY 2021-2023 Mitigation Strategy by advancing mitigation investment to reduce risks posed by natural hazards and increasing the nation\u2019s resilience to natural hazards. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy by enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of quality jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic and environmental benefits for disadvantaged communities. The BIL appropriates billions of dollars to FEMA to promote resilient infrastructure, respond to the impacts of climate change, and equip our nation with the resources to combat its most pressing threats. Objectives FMA aims to implement projects that reduce flood risks posed to repetitively flooded properties insured under the NFIP. The FMA program also aims to promote equity in the delivery of funds in line with the Administration\u2019s Justice40 Initiative, established by Executive Order (EO) 14008: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, which has made it the goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal climate, clean energy, and other investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. In implementing the Justice40 Initiative, the FMA program is prioritizing assistance that benefits disadvantaged communities as referenced in EO 14008 and subsequent guidance. FMA funds are sourced from congressionally appropriated funding from the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF) as well as funding made available for FY 23 Flood Mitigation Assistance via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The BIL funding allows increased federal cost share for a property: located within a census tract with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index score of not less than 0.5001.

Until the passage of the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-374) (Melville Act), the program operated as a separate program distinct from the regular tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Melville Act converted the Mainstream 5-Year Program to the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program under 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Under the Melville Act, except for serving a specific population, Mainstream vouchers are to be treated the same as regular voucher assistance. In other words, the same regulations at 24 CFR Part 982 (Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program) apply to Mainstream vouchers. There is no authority to treat families that receive a Mainstream voucher differently from other applicants and participants of the HCV program. After enactment of the Melville Act (i.e., subsequent to conversion of this assistance to section 8(o) voucher assistance), funding for Mainstream voucher renewals and administrative fees was first provided in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) under its own paragraph under the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) heading. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for the first time since the enactment of the Melville Act (in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding). These incremental vouchers exclusively assisted non-elderly persons with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (\"2019 Act\") also provided funding for incremental Mainstream vouchers for non-elderly persons with disabilities, in addition to renewal and administrative fee funding. In addition, the 2019 Act states that all new and existing Mainstream vouchers must be provided to non-elderly persons with disabilities upon turnover. Consistent with prior appropriations acts, all funding for 2017-2019 Mainstream vouchers was provided under its own paragraph (e.g., paragraph (4) under the TBRA heading in the 2019 Act).

Congress initially authorized up to $1.75 billion in Federal funds through Fiscal Year (FFY) 2011. With the subsequent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) in 2010, section 2403 extended the program through September 30, 2016. An additional $2.25 billion in Federal funds was appropriated through FFY 2016. Since then, section 2 of the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-3) added $112 million in Federal funds and changed the end date for the program from September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2021. Section 5 of the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-16) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Extenders Act from $112 million to $132 million and section 4 of the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L 116-39) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act from $132 million to $254.5 million. Section 205 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) and section 3811 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (P.L. 116-136) provided an additional $337.5 million. Section 2301 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-159) added $66.4 million, section 1107 of the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021, and other Extensions Act (P.L. 116-215) added $6.5 million. Section 204 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) added $1.253 billion, extended and made changes to the program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (P.L.117-328) added $1.8 billion and extends the program through September 30, 2027. Any funds remaining at the end of each fiscal year carry over to the next fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards to current grantees through FY 2027. Any unused grant funds awarded in FY 2027 can be used through FY 2031. No additional funding will be available after the final 2027 awards are made; however, grantees will submit documentation to identify projected costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2029 with services being provided and eligible for MFP-enhanced match through December 31, 2030. All claiming of services must be finalized by September 30, 2031. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their choice; (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions,; and (4) put procedures in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS. The demonstration provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 60 consecutive days. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible. Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with a \"qualified HCBS program\" which is a program that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition. States will be required to participate in a national qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted by CMS. Data collected on a national level will help evaluate the core objectives of the statute.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"(Money Follows the Person Demonstration)","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services"}},"assistanceTypes":["Government - General"],"applicantTypes":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"TC.140","title":"Distributions from retirement plans for premiums for health and long-term care insurance","permalink":"/program/TC.140","obligations":490000000.0,"objectives":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated and deferred payments, should be included in taxable income.

Extramural programs plan, develop, and manage scientific priorities through portfolio analyses and consultation with stakeholders, encouraging the most promising discoveries and emerging technologies for rapid translation to clinical applications. The Integrative Biology and Infectious Diseases programs support basic and translational research programs on oral microbiology; salivary biology and immunology; oral and salivary gland cancers; neuroscience of orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders; mineralized tissue physiology; dental biomaterials; and tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The branch aims to accelerate progress in basic and translational research in these areas, and further stimulate the discovery pipeline based on clinical needs. The Translational Genomics Research programs support basic and translational research in genetics, genomics, developmental biology, and data science toward the goal of improving dental, oral, and craniofacial health. The focus is on deciphering the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms underlying dental, oral, and craniofacial development and anomalies. The Behavioral and Social Sciences Research programs support basic and applied research to promote oral health, to prevent oral diseases and related disabilities, and to improve management of craniofacial conditions, disorders, and injury. The program prioritizes mechanistic research that contributes to a cumulative science of behavior change, to maximize the rigor, relevance, and dissemination of efficacious behavior change interventions. The Clinical Research programs supports patient-oriented, population, and community based research aimed at improving the dental, oral, and craniofacial health of the nation. The Center focuses on a variety of diseases and conditions through clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, practice-based research, the HIV/AIDS and oral health program, and studies of oral health disparities and inequities in all areas of NIDCR programmatic interest. The program encourages investigations that have the potential to translate findings into evidence-based clinical applications. The Research Training and Career Development extramural programs span the career stages of scientists, supporting research training and career development for PhD and dual degree DDS/DMD-PhD students, postdoctoral scholars and early career, midcareer, and established investigators. The programs manage support for fellowships, research training grants, career development and career transition awards, NIH loan repayment awards, and diversity supplements to support research experiences for high school students through investigators.

This is accomplished by establishing, improving, and/or maintaining statewide, tribal, or regional networks that provide real-time psychiatric consultation, a spectrum of resource and referral services, and culturally and linguistically appropriate training to maternity care providers and clinical practices.  The Pediatric Mental Health Care Access (PMHCA) program promotes behavioral health integration in pediatric primary care by supporting the planning and development of State, regional or tribal pediatric mental health care tele-consultation access programs that help these, and other providers including in emergency departments and schools diagnose, treat, and refer children with behavioral health conditions. PMHCA works to address the shortages of psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, and other behavioral health clinicians to support children and adolescents with behavioral concerns. The Integrated Maternal Health Services program fosters the development and demonstration of integrated maternal health services models, such as the maternity medical home, which is modeled after the patient-centered medical home. The purpose of the program is to improve maternal health outcomes in the United States by increasing access to quality, equitable, comprehensive care for pregnant and postpartum people who experience health disparities and have limited access to basic social and health care services. The Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program promotes safety and quality of care during and immediately after childbirth and addresses the high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. It is the national, cross-sector commitment designed to lead in the identification, development, implementation, and dissemination of patient safety bundles for the promotion of safe care for every U.S. birth. The AIM Technical Assistance Center supports all entities participating in the AIM program to increase birthing facility engagement, support bundle implementation and sustainability, manage reporting and analysis of state AIM data, and promote safe care for pregnant and postpartum people. The State Maternal Health Innovation program creates state-led maternal health task forces to bring together the voices of key leaders, and pregnant and postpartum individuals using state-specific maternal health data to develop and implement innovative approaches to address the most pressing maternal health needs and disparities. State approaches include strengthening partnerships and collaborations, improving state-level data surveillance on maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity, and promoting and executing innovation in maternal health service delivery.   \n\nThe MCH Research Portfolio includes the MCH Research Network (MCH RN), MCH Field-Initiated Innovative Research Studies (MCH FIRST), and MCH Secondary Data Analysis (MCH SDAR) programs.

NCCIH seeks to build knowledge across disciplines, focusing on the whole person, and taking a transdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural, social, and health sciences and transcends traditional boundaries. To address the need for objective evidence on the fundamental science, safety and efficacy of complementary and integrative health approaches, NCCIH supports rigorous scientific investigation to better understand how these interventions impact health, for whom, and the optimal methods of practice and delivery. By deepening our scientific understanding of the connections that exist across domains of human health, we can better understand how conditions interrelate, define multicomponent interventions that address these problems, and expand how we support patients through the full continuum of their health experience, including the return to health.\nTo evaluate  complementary and integrative health approaches.  The following objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and practice.\n\nResearch Approaches\nBasic, translational, efficacy/effectiveness, and implementation research for Complementary and Integrative Health approaches need to be studied across the research continuum.  NCCIH continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; this research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design and implement definitive clinical research and \"real world\" outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.\n\nNCCIH\u2019s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"National Institutes of Health"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federal","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"93.732","title":"Mental and Behavioral Health Education and Training Grants ","permalink":"/program/93.732","obligations":135408237.0,"objectives":"The purpose of the behavioral health programs is to develop and expand the behavioral health workforce and address mental health and provider resiliency concerns among health care workers.

By providing emergency economic assistance that keeps people off the streets, from being evicted from their homes, or with groceries to prevent hunger, the EFSP prepares a population that could otherwise be even more adversely impacted by a disaster situation and mitigates potential burdens imposed on recovery efforts to assist such people. For additional details on the NPG, please refer to http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf. FYs 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023 supplemental program funding was provided to EFSP for humanitarian relief, such as shelter and other services to migrant families and individuals encountered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"(EFSP)","agency":{"title":"Department of Homeland Security","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Emergency Management Agency"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"TC.016","title":"Amortize all geological and geophysical expenditures over 2 years","permalink":"/program/TC.016","obligations":130000000.0,"objectives":"The baseline tax system allows taxpayers to deduct the decline in the economic value of an investment over its economic life.

It does so with a recognition of the growing flood hazards associated with climate change, anticipated growth of damage and repetitive losses due to flood, and of the need for flood hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation, equity, and resilience with respect to flooding. These include both acute, extreme weather events as well as chronic stressors that have been observed and are expected to increase in the future. \n\nObjectives\nThe purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk of repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. \n\nFMA Swift Current funds Project Scoping and Individual Flood Mitigation Projects for Repetitive Loss (RL), Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL), or properties deemed Substantially Damaged after the applicant\u2019s disaster declaration incident period start date.

In FY 2024, funds will be made available on a rolling basis to states, territories, and federally recognized tribal governments that receive a major disaster declaration for a flood-related disaster event and meet all other eligibility criteria. FMA Swift Current aims to streamline funding through disaster declaration and flood insurance claims based eligibility criteria, minimized application periods, and narrowed project type eligibility to Individual Flood Mitigation Projects that are Severe Repetitive Loss, Repetitive Loss, and Substantially Damaged. This differs from the existing FMA grant opportunity, which has an annual grant cycle that funds a broader range of flood mitigation activities, which includes Capability and Capacity Building Activities, Localized Flood Risk Reduction Projects, and Individual Flood Mitigation Projects through a competitive selection process.\nFMA Swift Current aligns with the 2020-2024 DHS Strategic Plan through pursuing Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience. Specifically, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness has several sub-objectives that the FMA Program supports. FMA Swift Current serves primarily to bolster Sub-Objective 5.1.1: Incentivize investments that reduce risk and increase pre-disaster mitigation, including expanding the use of insurance to manage risk through funding hazard mitigation projects, particularly ones that reduce risk to NFIP-insured structures. Additionally, FMA Swift Current\u2019s tailored pre-application support also contributes to other sub-objectives. It helps improve awareness initiatives to encourage public action to increase preparedness (Sub-Objective 5.1.2), uses lessons from past disasters and exercises to inform community investment decisions and anticipate challenges that may emerge during future disasters (Sub-Objective 5.1.3), and coordinates and guide continuity of operations activities through partnerships with government and non-government stakeholders (Sub-Objective 5.1.5).

Factors such as poverty, inadequate housing, poor health care, and other debilitating social conditions, commonly referred to as social determinants of health, contribute to long-standing disparities and health inequities.\nThese social conditions contribute to the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US population. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US; stroke is the 5th leading cause.  In 2020, about 1 in 5 adults who died from CVD were younger than 65 years old. It is estimated that 1 in 9 health care dollars are spent on CVD.   \nCVD mortality rates declined for several decades due to both clinical and public health interventions, but recently declining death rates from both heart disease and stroke have stalled. One reason is that hypertension, the primary risk factor for CVD, is very common (1 in 2 US adults has hypertension) but control is not. Only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension (26.1%) has it under control.\nGains have been made in treating high cholesterol, another primary risk factor for CVD. Overall, the age-adjusted prevalence of high cholesterol decreased from 21% to 10% from 1988\u20131994 to 2017\u20132018.  This improvement is due in part to individuals\u2019 healthy behaviors such as eating a healthy diet, losing weight, being physically active, and medication adherence, along with clinical contributions from appropriate prescribing and intensification of medication. Additional public health and health system interventions aimed at preventing, detecting, and controlling elevated cholesterol and blood pressure can help to further decrease CVD mortality. \nThis program aims to implement and evaluate evidence-based strategies contributing to the prevention and management of CVD in populations disproportionately at risk. Given the importance of health equity, this program addresses social and economic factors to help communities and health systems respond to social determinants present in their communities to offer those at risk of or burdened with CVD the best health outcomes possible.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":null,"agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"87.052","title":"Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council Oil Spill Impact Program","permalink":"/program/87.052","obligations":75467833.0,"objectives":"The primary objective of this program is to disburse funds to eligible entities for the purpose of restoring and protecting the natural resources, ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, coastal wetlands, and economy of the Gulf Coast region using the best available science in accordance with an approved State Expenditure Plan.

The 28 estuaries of national significance, or NEPs, use an ecosystem-based management approach to help achieve their protection and restoration goals. For example, each NEP characterizes the priority problems in its estuary and surrounding watershed, develops a long-term plan known as a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) that identifies actions to address those problems, and identifies partners, including lead entities, who will implement those actions. Implementation of CCMPs can include the following actions: protecting and restoring habitat, including wetlands; supporting water quality protection and restoration, including Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) plan implementation; monitoring for, assessing the extent of toxics loadings and pathogen contamination, and taking steps to address excess loadings and contamination; implementing stormwater management, reducing non-point source pollution impacts, and promoting the adoption of green infrastructure approaches; preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and/or managing their impacts; developing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies; conducting climate vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate change adaptation strategies and using adaptation tools to promote coastal resilience; and developing and implementing strategies to provide opportunities for residents of urban minority and/or under-served communities to have greater access to urban waters, participate in urban ecosystem restoration, and participate in capacity-building/educational activities. In addition to CCMP implementation, NEPs and other eligible recipients, address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal areas. NEP projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (IIJA, Public Law 117-58), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), should seek to: accelerate and more extensively implement CCMPs, ensure that benefits reach disadvantaged communities, build the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities to climate change, and leverage additional resources, including from other IIJA programs. After approval of each estuary program\u2019s equity strategy, EPA will waive non-federal cost-share requirements for FY 2024 \u2013 FY 2026 IIJA funds. The purpose of the equity strategy is to ensure that each NEP is reviewing potential projects and utilization of IIJA funds through the lens of equitable and fair access to the benefits from environmental programs for all individuals. The equity strategy should outline how IIJA funds will be utilized to increase investments in disadvantaged communities and the benefits that flow to them. EPA's funding priority is to award assistance agreements that support the 28 National Estuary Programs' (NEPs) efforts to address their estuarine watersheds' priority problems identified in each of the 28 long-term management plans known as Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs). EPA will provide focused support for NEPs to address priority problems identified by NEP management conferences and to document accomplishments and environmental results. NEP efforts address such problems as: (1) impacts on estuarine water quality and living resources of nutrients, toxics (chemical, heavy metals), pathogen contamination, and sediment attributable to excess loadings and non-point stormwater runoff; e.g., excess nutrient loadings can result in nutrient over-enrichment and hypoxic conditions in estuarine water bodies; (2) habitat loss/degradation; (3) risks to CCMP implementation due to climate change impacts, and adaptation strategies to build regional, local, and tribal officials' capacity to address climate change impacts on NEP watersheds, and to promote community resilience. Activities that build capacity include conducting vulnerability assessments and developing and implementing climate adaptation strategies and programs; and 4) need for decision makers in estuarine communities to implement sustainable land use, green infrastructure, and low-impact development best practices. In FY 2023, EPA also funded through the NEP Coastal Watersheds Grant an intermediary organization to fund subawards that support projects that address urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic well-being of coastal and estuarine areas.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"NEP","agency":{"title":"Environmental Protection Agency","subAgency":{"title":"N/A"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Interstate","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"10.351","title":"Rural Business Development Grant","permalink":"/program/10.351","obligations":57916937.0,"objectives":"To promote sustainable economic development and facilitate the development of small and emerging private business, industry, and related employment for improving the economy in rural communities.

Toward achievement of the ultimate goal of eliminating community violence, the CBVP Program has three main objectives: to change community norms regarding violence; to provide alternatives to violence when gangs and individuals in the community are making risky behavior decisions; and, to increase awareness of the perceived risks and costs of involvement in violence among high-risk young people. The CBVP Program supports effective use of focused deterrence (enforcement) strategies and public health and education approaches to stop violence. This will be accomplished by supporting communities to establish and strengthen partnerships between law enforcement and outreach workers, clergy, community leaders and family members in efforts to deter young people from committing violence, particularly shootings and killings.

The DHS COEs work closely with DHS Components, as well as other homeland security operators at state, local, and tribal levels to research, develop and transition mission-relevant science and technology solutions. Additionally, the DHS COEs also work to educate the current and next generation of highly skilled homeland security science and engineering professionals. \nTo accomplish this objective, DHS S&T has developed the following DHS Centers of Excellence (COEs) and associated objectives: The Arctic Domain Awareness Center: Addressing Rapid Changes through Technology, Innovation, and Collaboration (ADAC-ARCTIC) conducts research and education activities to addresses critical gaps for federal state, local and tribal operators with Arctic homeland security missions, tackling challenges such as maritime safety, infrastructure protection, and emergency response. The Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE) develops enhanced analytic tools to enable homeland security operators to realize achievable improvements in operational efficiency, and to support real-time decisions related to homeland security threats and hazards. The research will aid in identifying the economic impact of security threats and hazards, and to critically assess risks to operators missions and the people and property they protect. The Cross Border Threat Screening and Supply Chain Defense (CBTS) Center develops solutions, protocols, and capabilities that detect, assess, and respond to known and unknown biological threats and hazards that could adversely impact the Nation\u2019s people, agriculture, and economy. The Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis (CINA) Center provides solutions to Federal, State and Local Law Enforcement that enhance investigation strategies to counter the proliferation of transnational criminal networks, cross-border criminal activities, and the growth in criminal use and exploitation of the cyber domain. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI) conducts research that enhances the ability to prepare and more rapidly recover from catastrophic disruptions, supporting DHS, State, Local and industry partners ability to solve complex, interdisciplinary challenges that affect critical infrastructure. The Coastal Resilience Center (CRC)  conducts research that strengthens the Nation\u2019s ability to safeguard people, infrastructure, and economies from catastrophic hazards such as floods and hurricanes. The overarching goal of the Center is to advance the understanding of coastal hazards and support successful planning and recovery by the public and private entities most impacted by these events. The Soft-target Engineering to Neutralize the Threat Reality (SENTRY) Center focuses efforts to protect transportation environments and public venues, improving systems of collaboration across the many public and private entities, mainly at the state and local levels, as well as producing new engineering approaches to securing crowded spaces with novel design concepts. The goal of SENTRY is to advance research that safeguards spaces where traditional methods to physical security are impractical to implement at scale.

Rural areas, for the purposes of this competition, are defined as local areas with populations of 50,000 or less that have limited access to public or private resources commonly found in metropolitan areas. Applicants claiming rural status must provide sufficient detail (census data, population figures, descriptions of local resources, etc.) for EPA to validate the rural status of the underserved community. The goal of this special consideration is to encourage and increase project performance in rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants program. 2) Health Impact Assessments (HIA) \u2013 HIA is a tool designed to investigate how a proposed program, project, policy, or plan may impact health and well-being and inform decision-makers of these potential outcomes before the decision is made. EPA may give special consideration to HIA projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those effects within the communities. 3) Projects addressing Climate, Disaster Resiliency, and/or Emergency Preparedness \u2013 The effects of climate change and extreme weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration to projects that address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that have been adversely impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and future pandemics.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"EJCPS","agency":{"title":"Environmental Protection Agency","subAgency":{"title":"N/A"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"10.448","title":"Rural Development Multi-Family Housing Rural Housing Voucher Program","permalink":"/program/10.448","obligations":42728904.0,"objectives":"The Rural Housing Voucher Demonstration program is designed to provide rental housing assistance vouchers to tenants in properties that pay off their Rural Development mortgage.

The goal of the National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that will assure protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP), the Action Agenda, has a goal to restore and maintain the Puget Sound Estuary's environment by meeting 2022-2026 ecosystem targets. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient, and pathogen pollution. This program has the following main objectives: First, implementing the approved CCMP, the Action Agenda for Puget Sound, is the primary objective of this program. Funds are directed to the highest priority work as articulated in every four-year update to the Action Agenda work plan. The updated work plan identifies implementation strategies to achieve reductions in the harmful impacts on Puget Sound and restore previously damaged aquatic ecosystem functions. A central component of the approved CCMP for Puget Sound is its Science Work Plan which identifies some of the core scientific work that must be completed for Action Agenda implementation efforts to succeed. This program is to support implementation of priority near term actions and to support the technical studies and investigations that are needed to help direct implementation priorities and help support the tracking systems and evaluation approaches for implementation activities. Together with projects aimed at achievement of specific environmental outcomes, the science studies and technical investigations inform adaptive management of the program significantly contributing to the restoration and protection of Puget Sound. The program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using IIJA funds.

The Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has implemented this by competitively awarding 50%/50% cost-shared cooperative agreements to commercial entities and providing funds to the DOE National Laboratories to support development of non-HEU Mo-99 production technologies. Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in over 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures performed daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart disease and cancer, as well as studying organ structure and function. The isotope\u2019s short half-life and excellent binding properties make it uniquely suited for medical procedures. However, due to its short half-life it must be produced continuously to meet the medical community\u2019s requirements. The United States does not currently have a domestic production capability for Mo-99 sufficient to meet the needs of the U.S. healthcare community, currently estimated at 4,500 6-day curies per week. The establishment of reliable, commercial, non-HEU-based Mo-99 production in the United States complements the long-standing U.S. policy to minimize and eliminate the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications in order to prevent the potential theft of this material for malevolent use. The United States is at the nexus of two related priorities: the need to ensure a reliable, robust Mo-99 supply for U.S. patient care, and discouraging the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications. NNSA will issue Cooperative Agreements with the purpose of providing additional federal funding to accelerate commercial Mo-99 projects\u2019 time to market so that industry and government can fulfill these two critical priorities and decrease the U.S. medical community\u2019s reliance on foreign supplies of Mo-99.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"Technology for Demonstration and Commercial Scale Production of a Reliable, Domestic Supply of Molybdenum-99 without the Use of Highly Enriched Uranium","agency":{"title":"Department of Energy","subAgency":{"title":"N/A"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Other public institution/organization","Profit organization"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"10.352","title":"Value-Added Producer Grants","permalink":"/program/10.352","obligations":31980722.0,"objectives":"To help agricultural producers enter into value-added activities related to the processing and/or marketing of bio-based, value-added products.

The goal of the National Estuary Program is to attain and maintain water quality in designated estuaries that would assure protection of public water supplies and the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous population of shellfish, fish and wildlife and allows recreational activities in and on the water. The Puget Sound National Estuary Program's approved Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) is the Action Agenda. The Action Agenda for Puget Sound charts the course to recovery of our nation's largest estuary\u2013it complements and incorporates the work of many partners from around Puget Sound to describe regional strategies and specific actions needed to recover Puget Sound. These strategies and actions provide opportunities for federal, state, local, tribal, and private entities to better invest resources and coordinate actions. The EPA is committed to protecting and improving water quality and minimizing the adverse impacts of rapid development in the Puget Sound Basin. These commitments include protecting the watersheds and waters of Puget Sound by protecting the fundamental watershed processes that provide and create aquatic habitats and by reducing the generation and release of toxic, nutrient, and pathogen pollution. The Puget Sound Protection and Restoration: Tribal Implementation Assistance Program is aimed at assisting the Indian Tribes of the greater Puget Sound basin in their efforts to carry out work critically needed for Puget Sound protection and restoration. This work includes activities identified in, or consistent with, the Action Agenda such as efforts called for by established salmon recovery plans in the Puget Sound basin. EPA has a trust responsibility to Federally recognized Indian Tribes. EPA also recognizes that Federally recognized Indian Tribes in the greater Puget Sound basin have a critical role in the protection and restoration of the ecosystem and its resources. EPA seeks to provide financial assistance to these Tribes to help them implement priority strategies and actions in or consistent with the approved Clean Water Act \u00a7320 CCMP for Puget Sound. Program has considered relevant approaches to achieving the intended goals and objectives of the program consistent with statutory requirements, including priorities in Executive Order 14052 (Implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), to invest public dollars equitably, create jobs and high labor stands, ensure goods and services are made in America, and build infrastructure that is resilient and helps combat the climate crisis using Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds. .

The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests. There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users\u2019 needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 1.

To better support land management decisions regarding grazing and other range management treatments, soils management, and invasive species, the BLM will place a priority on collecting data through the use of consistent, comparable, and common indicators, consistent methods, and an unbiased sampling framework which will allow for analyses that are repeatable and comparable across a region, and decisions based on science and data that are legally defensible. Land health assessments completed at a larger scale will be more efficient and less costly over time and provide timely support for decision-making. The Rangeland Management program conducts inventories, assessments and evaluations of soil and vegetation conditions and land health.

This objective is facilitated by supporting the development and implementation of regional catastrophic preparedness plans. These plans are designed to identify the risks, challenges, and potential impacts of catastrophic disasters and establish strategies for coordinating response efforts across multiple jurisdictions and disciplines to reduce long-term vulnerability. \n\nTo enhance the capacity of regions to identify and address gaps in planning, training, and exercises related to catastrophic events. Through the RCPGP, regions can identify areas where they lack preparedness and allocate resources to address those gaps, thereby increasing community resiliency and community readiness. Additionally, the program funds exercises and training opportunities that help communities practice and improve their response to catastrophic events. \n\nTo improve the readiness and resilience of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, communication networks, community housing and shelters (one of three RCPGP core capabilities for FY 2023), and public health facilities, in the event of a catastrophic incident. This includes identifying critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, conducting risk assessments, and developing strategies to mitigate those risks. The RCPGP also encourages collaboration and coordination to ensure a more comprehensive and integrated approach to disaster response. \n\n\nTo increase public awareness and understanding of the risks associated with catastrophic events and the importance of preparedness measure by supporting initiatives that promote public education and outreach, particularly to disadvantaged communities to increase equity. \n\nThese objectives are achieved over the program's multi-year timeframe and are monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure progress towards achieving them.

Advances in telehealth are transforming health care from a service delivered through traditional brick and mortar health care facilities to connected care options delivered via a broadband Internet access connection directly to the patient\u2019s home or mobile location. Despite the numerous benefits of connected care services, patients who cannot afford or who otherwise lack reliable, robust broadband Internet access connectivity, including many low-income Americans and veterans, are not realizing the benefits of these innovative telehealth technologies. The costs necessary to provide connected care services may also limit some health care providers\u2019 ability to treat patients, particularly low-income Americans and veterans, with connected care services. To address this, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) established the Connected Care Pilot Program (Pilot Program) within the Universal Service Fund (USF or Fund) to provide funding up to $100 million over three years and to examine how the Fund can help support the trend towards connected care services, particularly for low-income Americans and veterans. The Pilot Program was set up to help defray eligible health care providers\u2019 costs of providing connected care services, with a particular emphasis on supporting these services for eligible low-income Americans and veterans. The Commission expects that the Pilot Program will benefit many low-income and veteran patients who are responding to a wide variety of health challenges such as public health epidemics, opioid dependency, mental health conditions, high-risk pregnancy, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, and heart disease. The Commission also expects that the Pilot Program will provide meaningful data that will help better understand how USF funds can support health care provider and patient use of connected care services, and how supporting health care provider and patient use of connected care services can improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"Connected Care Pilot Program","agency":{"title":"Federal Communications Commission","subAgency":{"title":"N/A"}},"assistanceTypes":["Interstate"],"applicantTypes":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"93.564","title":"Child Support Services Research","permalink":"/program/93.564","obligations":4000000.0,"objectives":"This program provides federal funds for experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Section 1115, Part D of Title IV  of the Social Security Act, which stipulates that \"the project - 1) must be designed to improve the financial well-being of children or otherwise improve the operation of the child support program; 2) may not permit modifications in the child support program which would have the effect of disadvantaging children in need of support; and 3) must not result in increased cost to the federal government under Part A of such title.

NEHRP implements the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD -8) objective of hazard mitigation, to develop and maintain those capabilities necessary to reduce the loss of lives and property by lessening the impact of earthquakes. In an effort to provide eligible States and Territories with multiple funding and project management options, as well as to allow for multi-state coordination of projects, the Earthquake State Assistance grant program utilizes two separate funding opportunities: Individual State Earthquake Assistance (ISEA), and Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance (MSNEA). The Individual State Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity provides funding directly to those States and Territories that have been determined to be at a high, or a very high risk of earthquakes, and who can provide the statutory 25 percent cost-share. They must also be able to demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State. Funding is provided to eligible States and Territories through non-competitive grants that are administered by FEMA Regional earthquake program management staff. Allowable activities include: Support of seismic mitigation planning, developing inventories and conducting seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifeline infrastructure, updating building codes, zoning codes, and ordinances to enhance seismic safety, increasing earthquake awareness and education, participation in emergency management exercises that substantially benefit earthquake mitigation efforts, and the promotion of earthquake insurance. Additionally, the Multi-State and National Earthquake Assistance funding opportunity is designed to facilitate the development and management of National, regional and multi-state earthquake risk reductions activities. Funding is made available through competitive grants to nonprofit organizations, as defined by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.70 and institutions of higher education as defined by 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.55.

These networks contribute to surveillance for emerging infectious diseases, including drug resistant, foodborne and waterborne, and vaccine-preventable or potentially vaccine-preventable diseases, and enhance information exchange leading to early identification of and response to trends and outbreaks. \r\nObjectives for the provider-based sentinel networks include the following:\r\n-\tTo support linked groups of participating individuals or organizations in monitoring a variety of infectious disease problems and enhancing communication and collaboration among network members and the public health community;\r\n-\tTo serve as readily accessible mechanisms to address urgent public health infectious disease problems rapidly; and\r\n-\tTo improve understanding of specific public health issues, including, but not limited to, international travel, and enhance preparedness to meet new infectious disease threats among domestic and globally mobile populations.\r\nAdditional objectives for the \"research\" EISN include:\r\n-\tTo focus studies on the most important issues to be addressed by participating hospital EDs and CDC; and\r\n-\tTo estimate the community burden of diseases.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"NA","agency":{"title":"Department of Health and Human Services","subAgency":{"title":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Anyone/general public","Federal","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Government - General","Individual/Family","Interstate","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Minority group","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Non-Government - General","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"15.027","title":"Assistance to Tribally Controlled Community Colleges and Universities","permalink":"/program/15.027","obligations":3073653.0,"objectives":"To provide grants for the operation and improvement of Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) to insure continued and expanded educational opportunities for Indian students, and to allow for the improvement and expansion of the physical resources of such institutions.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":null,"agency":{"title":"Department of the Interior","subAgency":{"title":"Bureau of Indian Education"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"10.112","title":"Price Loss Coverage","permalink":"/program/10.112","obligations":3069746.0,"objectives":"The Price Loss Coverage program (PLC) is carried over from the 2014 Farm Bill.

Examples include chain of custody certification for sustainable wood products as well as life cycle analysis for a range of wood products.  \n\nIncrease the knowledge, information, and promotion of how carbon sequestration by wood products can provide a competitive edge to a sustainable forest products industry.  An example includes developing specific carbon storage factors for a range of wood products.\n\nDevelop technology and markets to address urgent issues on a global or domestic scale, including:              \n1) Sanitizing wood packaging materials, firewood, and similar products to eliminate these pathways for the transport of insect and disease pests, and                                                                         \n2) Developing markets for and using unexpected increases in the volume of urban and rural wood due to new pest introductions (for example, emerald ash borer) and weather events such as tornadoes and ice storms. \n\nIncrease the sustainable use of woody biomass to meet our Nation\u2019s needs for energy, raw materials, and reductions of hazardous fuels.  Examples include public/private partnerships for using woody biomass in heating and cooling, process energy, cogeneration, district energy systems, and solid and liquid fuel production.  Projects may also develop or maintain local markets and forest industry infrastructure by using woody biomass for both energy and value-added products.  Provide key information to address the economic, social and ecological aspects of woody biomass production and use: including sustainable supplies, harvesting techniques, forest management, plantation development, and environmental implications.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"WERC","agency":{"title":"Department of Agriculture","subAgency":{"title":"Forest Service"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Small business (less than 500 employees)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"20.724","title":"Pipeline Safety Research Competitive Academic Agreement Program (CAAP) ","permalink":"/program/20.724","obligations":2201496.0,"objectives":"The CAAP initiative is intended to spur innovation by enabling an academic research focus on high-risk and high pay-off solutions for the many pipeline safety challenges.

Section 102 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizes CISA to make cooperative agreements in carrying out these responsibilities. \n\nIn carrying out its mission and pursuant to these authorities, CISA provides financial assistance under the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program to non-federal entities to perform cybersecurity awareness activities to reduce cybersecurity risks through messaging, tools, and resources to encourage individuals and organizations to reduce their exposure to malicious cyber activity. Through strategies implemented year-round with a focal point of Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October, a recipient under a federal award will engage in efforts to improve the public\u2019s understanding of cyber threats, amplify opportunities that individuals and non-federal entities can leverage to strengthen their own cybersecurity posture, and encourage discussion, engagement, and actions that can be taken to reduce cyber risk. \n\nCISA has established the following six goals for the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program: (1) strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure; (2) assess and counter evolving cybersecurity risks through actions that promote threat risk reduction; (3) build a national culture of preparedness and ensure equity and accessibility to increase online and digital safety; (4) build stakeholder relationships that encourage and support data-driven actions by state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, other non-federal entities, and individuals that reduce cybersecurity risk; (5) reinforce the importance of secure by default and secure by design industry practices that do not place the first line of cyber threat risk reduction on those with the least capabilities and resources; and (6) encourage activities supported by data which result in key behavior change that reduce cyber risk.\n\nIn support of the six program goals, CISA has established the following six objectives for the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program: (1) educate the public and non-federal entities about the dangers of cyber threats and key actions to mitigate risks; (2) promote sustainable cybersecurity and encourage the technology industry to provide secure-by-default technology products and technology that is secure-by-design; (3) identify effective approaches to increase cybersecurity awareness among the general public and target audiences; (4) build relationships and coalitions across cybersecurity stakeholders to support Cybersecurity Awareness Month; (5) develop a baseline from which to measure the impact Cybersecurity Awareness Month campaign strategies and messaging has on changing behavior and increasing public awareness of cybersecurity risk; and (6) contribute to CISA\u2019s efforts to build a culture of preparedness. \n\nThe Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign Program aligns with Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure and Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience under the 2020-2024 Department of Homeland Security Strategic Plan.

This overarching programmatic goal of building state and local capabilities will be achieved through various means and methods, each one aimed at making achieving the National Preparedness Goal and furthering our collective efforts to remain a safe and secure nation. \n\nSpecific program activities anticipated for achieving this goal will include, but will not be limited to: \n\u2022\tproduction and dissemination of written products relating to emerging homeland security, emergency management and public safety issues and established or model state homeland security and emergency management efforts; \n\u2022\tproviding educational seminars, training and workshops for apprising newly appointed Governor\u2019s Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs) and Emergency Management Directors of federal homeland security doctrine, best-practices and established principles;\n\u2022\tfacilitating calls, meetings, or discussions amongst representatives from key stakeholder groups on a regular basis which serve to share information, knowledge, experiences, and practices relating to current and emerging homeland security, emergency management and public safety issues; and\n\u2022\tconvening trainings, workshops, and other meeting opportunities designed to bring together in a common forum nationwide Homeland Security Advisors, state, local and tribal Emergency Management Directors, as well as other professional organizations in the public and private sectors and to inform partners on the impacts of federal homeland security, emergency management and public safety legislation, regulations and policies on the states. \n\nEach recipient will conduct these specific activities to support State Emergency Management Directors, Homeland Security Advisors, and/or other SLTT emergency management officials to further build SLTT capabilities. An additional key purpose for the HSPTAP is that the program also furthers the building of a national system of emergency management capabilities that can effectively and efficiently utilize the full measure of the Nation's resources to respond to catastrophic incidents, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made emergencies or events. HSPTAP recipients will conduct activities that bring together the collective perspectives of state and local elected officials and the private sector to provide a broad-based sounding board on homeland security issues for all national stakeholders. The program will serve to establish, provide, and maintain a forum for organizations to exchange ideas, conduct targeted discussions, as well as to provide technical assistance to governors\u2019 offices, associations and organizations on all relevant homeland security policy areas. Finally, HSPTAP will engage the recipient organizations which can work closely with FEMA to develop, transfer, and institutionalize pertinent knowledge at the state, local, tribal and territorial levels for addressing current public policy challenges facing State EM Directors, HSAs, and other SLTT emergency management officials. HSPTAP recipients, through collaboration with FEMA and other national, regional, state and local entities, will facilitate focused and enhanced communication and coordination among all disciplines and levels of government to address the complex challenges of developing and implementing homeland security policies and practices including: intelligence sharing; State homeland security organization, structure and governance; communications interoperability; critical infrastructure protection; and all hazards disaster prevention, protection, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to include areas of emergency management, homeland security, fire, law enforcement, Emergency Management Services (EMS), agriculture, National Guard, emergency communications, and public works. In sum, in addition to building state and local capabilities, the activities conducted under the HSPTAP are structured to address the full spectrum of mission areas, national priorities, and core capabilities outlined in the National Preparedness System and are critical to achieving the National Preparedness Goal.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":"(HSPTAP)","agency":{"title":"Department of Homeland Security","subAgency":{"title":"Federal Emergency Management Agency"}},"assistanceTypes":["Project Grants"],"applicantTypes":["Nonprofit with 501C3 IRS Status (Other than Institution of Higher Education)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"81.279","title":"Law Enforcement Support of Pantex Plant","permalink":"/program/81.279","obligations":399999.0,"objectives":"The objective to provide reasonable and appropriate law enforcement \u201cPatrols\u201d in the near vicinity of the Pantex Plant.

Eligible schools, libraries, and consortia comprised of schools and libraries selected to participate in the Pilot Program may request and receive support through the Pilot Program to purchase a wide range of eligible cybersecurity services and equipment that best suit their particular needs, subject to budget ceilings, budget floors and per-student and per-library multipliers.  During this short-term Pilot Program, the Commission will gather key data on the types of cybersecurity services and equipment that K-12 schools and libraries need to protect their broadband networks and data, and ensure that students, school staff, and library patrons are able to connect to advanced communications that are integral to education. Data and information collected through this Pilot Program may also aid in the considerations of broader efforts across the government to help schools and libraries address their cybersecurity concerns.","gwo":null,"pons":"","popularName":null,"agency":{"title":"Federal Communications Commission","subAgency":{"title":"N/A"}},"assistanceTypes":["Interstate"],"applicantTypes":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization"],"categories":[]},{"cfda":"42.010","title":"Teaching with Primary Sources","permalink":"/program/42.010","obligations":0.0,"objectives":"Teaching with Primary Sources (TPS) grants seek to fulfill the mission of the Library of Congress to use its collections to connect with those representing diverse communities, beliefs, and endeavors to engage, inspire, and inform Congress and the American people with a universal and enduring source of knowledge and creativity.
