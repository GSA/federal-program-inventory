{"id":"93.568","name":"Low-Income Home Energy Assistance","popular_name":"LIHEAP","objective":"The objective of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is to make awards available to states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and Native American tribes and tribal organizations for the purpose of assisting eligible households to meet immediate home energy needs. The target population is low-income households, especially those with the lowest incomes and the highest home energy costs or needs in relation to income and family size. There are four components of LIHEAP: (1) block grants, (2) energy Emergency Contingency funds, (3) Leveraging Incentive awards, and (4) the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Program (REACH). Block grant funds are distributed by formula to recipients who design their own programs according to very broad federal guidelines. Emergency Contingency funds may be awarded to recipients in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency and typically must be utilized under the normal statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to block grants. Leveraging Incentive funds allows for HHS to set aside a portion of appropriated funding to reward recipients that have acquired non-federal resources to provide services to LIHEAP-eligible households beyond what could be provided by other federal funds. The REACH program makes competitive awards available to recipients to help eligible households reduce their energy vulnerability through community-based organizations. Contingency funds, Leveraging Incentive awards, and REACH funding are only administered when funding for those components is available and allocated to them. This program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of Community Services.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/5a39b602360c4b78a6fb142f00a44b26/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=bd754ad67d20c7dd624eaac5042e55bf","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.568","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Administration for Children and Families","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Low Income"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":6117256047.0,"usa_spending_actual":6078218900.11},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4139779910.0,"usa_spending_actual":4091965914.1},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4211000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":4099664008.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":5886764255.17,"obligation":6084449471.89},{"x":"2024","outlay":3694927386.9,"obligation":4122280396.88},{"x":"2025","outlay":1687666717.75,"obligation":4099664008.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"It is anticipated that 279 grants will be awarded in FY 2016. 211 grants awarded in FY 2016."},{"year":"2017","description":"211 grants were awarded."},{"year":"2018","description":"206 grants awarded in FY 2018."},{"year":"2019","description":"205 grants were funded in FY 2019."},{"year":"2022","description":"206 entities received regular LIHEAP FY 2022 funding.
