{"id":"15.255","name":"Science and Technology Projects Related to Coal Mining and Reclamation","popular_name":"Technology Development and Transfer Program","objective":"The goal of the OSMRE Applied Science Program is to develop and demonstrate improved science based technologies to address environmental, and restoration topics related to the mining of coal.  The first objective to help us meet this goal is to develop technical tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of regulatory authorities in permitting coal mines and administering their federally approved regulatory program.  A second objective is to examine the potential for new technologies that can aid in the protection of the public and the environment during mining and reclamation.  A third objective is to provide opportunities for college and university students to participate in research projects related to coal mining and reclamation issues in order to build a pool of qualified potential applicants for future implementation of SMCRA.\n\nMine Drainage Technology Initiative (MDTI) (formally known as the Acid Mine Drainage Initiative) provides a forum for collaboration and information exchange with the following goals:\n\u2022Develop an understanding of acidic and toxic mine drainage (MD) so as to better predict, avoid, monitor, and remediate mine drainage;\n\u2022Develop innovative solutions to acidic and toxic MD water-quality problems;\n\u2022Identify, evaluate, and develop \u201cbest science\u201d practices to predict acidic and toxic MD prior to mining; and\n\u2022Identify successful remediation practices for existing sources of acidic and toxic MD and describe the best technology for its prevention.\n\nOSMRE is looking for MDTI studies that address the goals listed above that have the potential for improving the effectiveness of both the coal industry and the regulatory authority to conduct and regulate surface coal mining and reclamation activities that protect the environment and the public.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/6bb4ad64ca20499dab3ce09ef3563312/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=1a95555f3efd6d00563f3bb788fbcd69","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.255","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Office of Surface Mining","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1968609.0,"usa_spending_actual":1790903.44},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1798317.0,"usa_spending_actual":1796065.37},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1800000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-2869.79}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":1561836.5,"obligation":1968609.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":623316.39,"obligation":1798316.62},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"OSMRE is currently funding two projects under the Acid Mine Drainage Technology Initiative (currently known as Mine Drainage Technology Initiative).
