{"id":"97.045","name":"Cooperating Technical Partners","popular_name":"(CTP)","objective":"The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program exists to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The CTP Program supports efforts to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience, one of six main goals of the DHS 2020-2024 Strategic Plan. Additionally, the program supports the National Mitigation Investment Strategy, a supporting document to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-8) on National Preparedness.   The goals of the CTP Program are to primarily support the mission and objectives of the NFIP\u2019s Flood Hazard Mapping Program through FEMA\u2019s flood hazard identification and risk assessment programs, including the Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) initiative. The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness of flood hazard risk and leads to action that reduces flood risk to life and property. The CTP supports Risk MAP to develop flood hazard data and maps for communities that have never had identified risks as well as building on effective flood hazard data and flood insurance rate maps (FIRMS); increase public awareness of risk and potential mitigation options to reduce risk and better inform mitigation planning. Additional information about Risk MAP (including goals, strategies, progress and success stories), can be found on FEMA\u2019s website at at Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) | FEMA.gov.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/442555cab91745cbb7e0edb9e55b6993/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=d3e0323916d5fd18011c90441fcd012c","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.045","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":"Federal Emergency Management Agency","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Small business","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":100000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":82987485.69},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":95000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":60334452.34},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-1898827.85}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":22510864.74,"obligation":84047002.13},{"x":"2024","outlay":2440938.78,"obligation":62727132.93},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":-74140.11}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"Award Rate (# awarded/# received): 100%\r\nTotal Federal Award: approximately $74 million \r\nTotal Applicant Match: approximately $12 million\r\n Total Federal Award: approximately $74 million \r\nTotal Applicant Match: approximately $12 million\r\n"},{"year":"2017","description":"Total Federal Award: approximately $64 million \r\nTotal Applicant Match: approximately $2 million\r\n"},{"year":"2018","description":"Total Federal Award: approximately $116 million \nTotal Applicant Match: approximately $30 million"},{"year":"2020","description":"Developed flood hazard data and maps for communities that have never had identified risks"},{"year":"2021","description":"The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program\u2019s mission is to strengthen the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and support the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA\u2019s) mitigation objectives.

This is in support of FEMA\u2019s Risk Mapping, Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) Program.  The performance measure identified in the FY22 NOFO is the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and is one measure of Earned Value (EV). At the program level, tracking SPI ensures that as a portfolio, CTP projects are delivered on time and within budget.  As of the end of third quarter 2022, the aggregate SPI for all CTPs is 0.92 which is within tolerance of the target of 1.0 (+/-.08).  In ongoing efforts to support Risk MAP objectives, over the course of FY21, the CTPs developed flood hazard products to deliver Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps to 482 communities.
