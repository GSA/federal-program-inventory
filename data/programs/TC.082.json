{"id":"TC.082","name":"Accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment (normal tax method)","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under a comprehensive economic income tax, the costs of acquiring machinery and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over time in accordance with the decline in the property\u2019s economic value due to wear and tear or obsolescence. This ensures that the net income from the property is measured appropriately each year. Current law allows depreciation deductions that are accelerated relative to economic depreciation. In particular, in 2023, 80 percent of the purchase cost of qualified property is eligible to be expensed immediately; this percentage phases out to zero through 2027. Additionally, subject to investment limitations, the Tax Code allows up to $1 million (indexed for inflation) in qualifying investments in tangible property and certain computer software to be expensed rather than depreciated over time. The depreciation provisions of the Tax Code are part of the reference tax law, and thus do not give rise to tax expenditures under reference tax law. Under the normal tax baseline, in contrast, depreciation allowances reflect estimates of economic depreciation.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":10430000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":-4040000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":-15430000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
