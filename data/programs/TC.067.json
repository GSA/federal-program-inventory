{"id":"TC.067","name":"Exception from passive loss rules for $25,000 of rental loss","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system accepts current law\u2019s general rule limiting taxpayers\u2019 ability to deduct losses from passive activities against nonpassive income (e.g., wages, interest, and dividends). Passive activities generally are defined as those in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, and there are numerous additional considerations brought to bear on the determination of which activities are passive for a given taxpayer. Losses are limited in an attempt to limit tax sheltering activities. Passive losses that are unused may be carried forward and applied against future passive income. In contrast to the general restrictions on passive losses, the Tax Code exempts certain owners of rental real estate activities from \u201cpassive income\u201d limitations. The exemption is limited to $25,000 in losses and phases out for taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $150,000.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":5470000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":8330000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":8660000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
