{"id":"10.978","name":"Farm Labor Stabilization and Protection Pilot Grant Program","popular_name":"Farm labor pilot program or FLSPP","objective":"USDA is offering a grant program focused on addressing labor shortages in agriculture, reducing irregular migration through expansion of legal pathways, and improving labor protections for farmworkers in order to improve the resiliency of our food and agricultural supply chain. . Furthermore, The program aims to improve the resiliency of our food and agricultural supply chain and advance several major administration priorities: \n\nDriving U.S. economic recovery and safeguarding domestic food security by addressing current labor shortages in agriculture. Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, agricultural employers were struggling to secure a stable workforce. The pandemic has only exacerbated this problem, threatening our domestic capacity to produce a safe and robust food supply. This pilot program will help address this shortage by expanding the potential pool of workers.\nReducing irregular migration through the expansion of legal pathways. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken numerous steps to address the elevated levels of irregular migration from Northern Central America. The H-2A visa program offers a lawful pathway for individuals from these countries to come to the United States to engage in temporary or seasonal agricultural work. An effective H-2A visa program is critical to the resiliency of the food and agricultural supply chain. This pilot program will aim to address challenges that both workers and employers face in utilizing the program.\nImproving working conditions for farmworkers. Strong working conditions are critical to the resiliency of the food and agricultural supply chain. Through this pilot program, USDA will support efforts to improve working conditions for both U.S. and H-2A workers and ensure that H-2A workers are not subjected to unfair recruitment practices.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/a0e68542c1454ee1b72086e50dcca225/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=2ba463b3c88dba7f72371092dc6c6ddd","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.978","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Profit organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":65000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":50000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"Awarded $50 million to 141 awardees in 40 states and Puerto Rico, through the Farm Labor Stabilization and Protection Pilot Program (FLSP Program), reaching 177 unique agricultural operations and over 11,000 workers."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"15 U.S.C. &sect; 9001.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/9001"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
