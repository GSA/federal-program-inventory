{"id":"15.237","name":"Rangeland Resource Management","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Rangeland Management Program administers grazing for more than 155 million acres of public land. This includes, but is not limited to, such things as inventorying, controlling and managing noxious weeds and invasive species; improving rangelands through grazing management, vegetation restoration treatments, and grazing management structures; and soil resource management. Coordination with land managers and other stakeholders is conducted to complete priority soil surveys, ecological site descriptions, and on-the-ground projects to improve soil stability and reduce erosion. Appropriate management of rangeland and soil resources also support actions and authorizations that include, but is not limited to, such things as endangered and special status species recovery, grazing of domestic livestock, recreation, forest management, hazardous fuels reduction, and post fire rehabilitation. To better support land management decisions regarding grazing and other range management treatments, soils management, and invasive species, the BLM will place a priority on collecting data through the use of consistent, comparable, and common indicators, consistent methods, and an unbiased sampling framework which will allow for analyses that are repeatable and comparable across a region, and decisions based on science and data that are legally defensible. Land health assessments completed at a larger scale will be more efficient and less costly over time and provide timely support for decision-making. The Rangeland Management program conducts inventories, assessments and evaluations of soil and vegetation conditions and land health. Monitoring data is collected and analyzed to ensure progress toward meeting land health standards.  Funded projects under this program will focus on high priority work such as activities that support maintaining or achieving land health and productivity, increasing carbon sequestration, and creating resilient landscapes to benefit current and future generations.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/598424300c054636841486cfe25c221d/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=9578c076b0a489d20bbbf3d6604efd21","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.237","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public"],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":17733464.0,"usa_spending_actual":17607870.65},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":14467974.0,"usa_spending_actual":15492085.73},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":1013926.72}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":7505632.19,"obligation":16491759.19},{"x":"2024","outlay":1036634.55,"obligation":4111819.19},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":45000.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"No Current Data Available.
