{"id":"TC.117","name":"Work opportunity tax credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers with a tax credit for qualified wages paid to individuals. The credit applies to employees who began work on or before December 31, 2025 and who are certified as members of various targeted groups. The amount of the credit that can be claimed is 25 percent of qualified wages for employment less than 400 hours and 40 percent for employment of 400 hours or more. Generally, the maximum credit per employee is $2,400 and can only be claimed on the first year of wages an individual earns from an employer. However, the credit for long-term welfare recipients can be claimed on second year wages as well and has a $9,000 maximum. Also, certain categories of veterans are eligible for a higher maximum credit of up to $9,600. Employers must reduce their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":2070000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":2050000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":2110000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
