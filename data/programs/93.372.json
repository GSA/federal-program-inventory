{"id":"93.372","name":"21st Century Cures Act -\tBrain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies","popular_name":"The BRAIN Initiative","objective":"To provide extramural research support for the Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies\u00ae\u202f(BRAIN) Initiative\u2019s aim of revolutionizing our understanding of the brain and its function in unprecedented detail. The NIH BRAIN Initiative\u2019s focus is foundational development of new technologies and tools to map, monitor, and modulate brain circuits in model systems and humans \u2013 toward the ultimate goal of treating and curing human brain disorders. BRAIN Initiative research adheres to open, ethical, and inclusive science \u2013 and requires diverse expertise across all domains. BRAIN-supported research areas include comprehensive cataloguing, mapping, accessing and characterization of brain cell types ; probing neural circuits that interact and produce behavior, cognition, and emotion; developing and employing new \u202ftechnologies to monitor function and connectivity of synapses, circuits, and whole brains; partnering with human research participants, including \u202futilizing neurotechnologies in first-in-human clinical studies, to study the human brain in the context of brain injury and brain disorders; and establishing data-sharing platforms and computational models that help decode brain processes and functions. Within these scientific focus areas, the Initiative supports research project grants, cooperative agreements, workforce development awards and Small Business Innovation Research awards. Research supported by the Initiative has a strong commitment to broad dissemination of newly developed technologies, and to considering neuroethical issues related to studying the human brain and the neuroscience advances that follow from this research. New frontiers for BRAIN research will adhere to, and build on, what has been learned to date and adapt to the rapidly changing scientific landscape and neuroscience ecosystem.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/d97da5cecdbc413e8c19651cadb7d90f/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=33d8f18df87d49bfc0efed81e8cc7b9e","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.372","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"National Institutes of Health","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Other public institution/organization"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":450000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":187622638.93},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":172000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":95427212.55},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":91000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":19234256.91}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":239509052.11,"obligation":210467171.65},{"x":"2024","outlay":34483318.65,"obligation":25967280.27},{"x":"2025","outlay":255620.36,"obligation":6697693.03}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"N/A"},{"year":"2017","description":"$10,000,000"},{"year":"2018","description":"$86,000,000"},{"year":"2021","description":"NIH BRAIN Initiative-funded researchers (funded from all of these scientific priority areas) have made significant advances \u2013 made possible in part by 21st Century Cures funding.
