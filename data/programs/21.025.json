{"id":"21.025","name":"Small Dollar Loan Program","popular_name":"SDL Program","objective":"Through the Small Dollar Loan Program, the CDFI Fund provides (1) grants  to enable a certified Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) or any partnership between a certified CDFI and federally insured depository institution, with a primary mission to serve targeted Investment Areas, to establish a loan-loss reserve fund to cover the losses on small dollar loans from a new small dollar program or an existing small dollar loan program; and (2) grants for Technical Assistance to a certified CDFI or any partnership between or among certified CDFIs to establish and maintain small dollar loan programs.  Small Dollar Loan Program grants cannot be used to provide direct loans to consumers. This program is intended to provide an alternative to high-cost small dollar loans, as well as help unbanked and underbanked populations build credit, access affordable capital, and allow greater access into the mainstream financial system.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/7d09f23a95cf445589bca7c6fa567eea/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=8037d09a33c548f4940668722b302474","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=21.025","top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Community Development Financial Institutions Fund","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Other private institutions/organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-271988.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":17563688.0,"usa_spending_actual":17475950.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":9148895.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":17357113.0,"obligation":17563688.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2022","description":"Visit the CDFI Fund website for information on program accomplishments.
