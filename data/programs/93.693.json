{"id":"93.693","name":"Nursing Home Staffing Campaign","popular_name":"NHSC","objective":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is committed to improving safety and quality of care in the Nation\u2019s Nursing Homes. Nursing home staffing has been known as a critical factor for improving care for nursing home residents for many years. However, there have been challenges with nursing homes\u2019 ability to obtain enough nursing staff to meet each resident\u2019s needs. The Nursing Home Staffing (NHS) Campaign project is aimed at increasing the availability of nurses (e.g., registered nurses (RNs) to work in the nursing home environment, such as in qualifying nursing homes or in an oversight capacity for a state inspection agency. \n\nThrough this project, CMS will award multiple cooperative agreements to entities to who will in turn, administer financial incentives, such as tuition reimbursement and stipends to RNs who will then work in a qualifying nursing home or state survey agency for three years.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/24d4b11f5e9a4bb2a0acaa3c19bbc429/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=ff18bc1855b2336e8466fd8ee2692a97","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.693","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Public nonprofit institution/organization","State"],"applicant_types":["State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2025","description":"FY 2025: $20,000,000\nFY 2026: $20,000,000 (pending)\nFY 2027: $20,000,000 (pending)\nFY 2028: $10,000,000 (pending)\nFY 2029: $10,000,000 (pending)"}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Social Security Act (SSA), Title 18 and Title 19, 1819(h)(2)(B)(ii)(IV)(ff) and 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii)(IV)(ff), This program is being funded through civil money penalties (CMPs) that are imposed on nursing homes for noncompliance, and collected by CMS.
