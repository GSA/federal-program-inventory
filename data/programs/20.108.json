The   research is expected to substantially influence FAA, Aviation and Aerospace domains, and Human Factors communities through increasing face validity and content validity.\n\nAviation Research Grant awarded to George Mason University to develop and apply finite element modeling and simulation analysis methods for the calibration of material models that will be applied in aircraft engine containment and aircraft level assessment of uncontained debris analyses.\n\nAviation research grant awarded to University of Iowa to explore prototype display systems and future sensor technologies to increase safety and operational efficiency for helicopters while enhancing the safety case for reduced visibility minima. This research will enable helicopters to conduct approaches in low visibility conditions in both VMC and IMC weather to VFR helipads. This research will also support the development of operational criteria and airworthiness guidance (a public purpose) for enabling the use of technology for helicopter operations in a high-risk low-altitude environment."},{"year":"2019","description":"In Fiscal Year  2019 the FAA Aviation Research Grants Program continued to utilize research grant awards to support advanced research in areas of potential benefit to the long-term growth of civil aviation, and in areas related to the prevention of catastrophic failure of an aircraft, and to contribute to the FAA mission of improving aviation safety, capacity, efficiency, and security.  \n\nExamples of funded projects include:  Specification for use of nonnuclear technology in measuring properties of unbound pavement material; Methodologies to model tail cutoff location for Smart-DT input random variables; Lighting and visual guidance research for airport applications; Gamification of visual scanning strategies for training; Lighting and visual guidance research for airport applications; ATO Alarm Management."},{"year":"2020","description":"In Fiscal Year 2020 the FAA Aviation Research Grants Program continues to utilize research grant awards to support advanced research in areas of potential benefit to the long-term growth of civil aviation, and in areas related to the prevention of catastrophic failure of an aircraft, and to contribute to the FAA mission of improving aviation safety, capacity, efficiency, and security.
