{"id":"97.131","name":"Emergency Management Baseline Assessments Grant (EMBAG)","popular_name":"EMBAG","objective":"The purpose of the 2024 EMBAG cooperative agreement is to support the use of national-level standards for emergency management to help ensure that state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) communities have accredited emergency management programs and certified emergency managers in place before an incident occurs. To achieve this purpose, the EMBAG supports voluntary national-level standards and peer review assessment processes that communities can use to identify the capacity and shortfalls of their emergency management programs and emergency managers and develop a path to compliance with these standards. These national-level standards fall under \u201cother assistance\u201d called out under Section 503 (b)(2)(G) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \u201cbuild tribal, local, State, regional, and national capabilities\u2026necessary to respond to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster.\u201d See 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 313(b)(2)(G). \n\nThe EMBAG directly supports the DHS Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2020-2024, Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience, Objective 5.1: Build a National Culture of Preparedness and Objective 5.2: Respond During Incidents, by supporting efforts that can help ensure that state, tribal, territorial, and local communities have accredited emergency management programs and certified emergency managers in place before an incident occurs. The EMBAG program reinforces FEMA\u2019s mission of advancing all-hazards preparedness, consistent with the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) and Presidential Policy Directive 8 (PPD-8), National Preparedness. \n\nThe performance of the EMBAG is measured against the intended outcomes identified in the Objectives section of Section A: Program Description in the 2024 EMBAG NOFO. Applicants should refer to Appendix B: Detail on EMBAG Performance Measurement of the 2024 EMBAG NOFO for additional information on these metrics, including guidance and a template for reporting.
