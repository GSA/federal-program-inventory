{"id":"97.154","name":"Citizenship Integration Training Academy","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Office of Citizenship, Partnership and Engagement (OCPE), within US. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is charged with promoting instruction and training on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. USCIS recognizes that naturalization is a key milestone in the civic integration of immigrants. Naturalization requirements, such as knowledge of English and of U.S. history and civics, encourage civic learning and build a strong foundation upon which immigrants can fully integrate into society. Through preparing for naturalization, immigrants will gain the tools to become successful citizens and meet their responsibilities as United States citizens. The goal of the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program is to expand the availability of high-quality citizenship preparation services for lawful permanent residents (LPRs) across the nation and to provide opportunities for lawful permanent residents to gain the knowledge and training necessary to integrate into the fabric of American society. The Citizenship and Integration Grant Program supports the objectives of Executive Order 14012, Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans, by promoting integration, inclusion, and citizenship. Furthermore, the goals of the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program address the DHS mission to enforce and administer our immigration laws as stated in the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review as the program provides lawful permanent residents instruction on the rights and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship and information and support on how to apply for naturalization within the authorized practice of immigration law.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/100a7edb33dd4eccbe8435fb3f0f358c/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=e0e1e3f1b0adc09d65b0eb17c0be9281","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.154","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":"Citizenship & Immigration Services","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Refugee/Alien"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2400000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2600000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2499999.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2023","description":"Since it began in 2009, the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program has awarded more than $55 million through 644 competitive grants to immigrant-serving organizations in 41 states and the District of Columbia.
