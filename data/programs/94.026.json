{"id":"94.026","name":"AmeriCorps National Service and Civic Engagement Research Competition 94.026","popular_name":"National Service and Civic Engagement Research Competition 94.026","objective":"To further achieve its mission, AmeriCorps has a strong belief in the importance of research in order to identify effective strategies for national service and increase the evidence-base for its programs. This means engaging the broader community of academic researchers involved in studying and evaluating national service, volunteerism, and civic infrastructure. The goal of this competition is to increase the nation\u2019s understanding and knowledge about the importance and potential of volunteering, national and community service, and/or civic engagement in America.  We are seeking applications that build on existing research in the field, address gaps in knowledge, and provide new ideas and methodological approaches to the study of national service.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/0934820a72f3427789b52cde96939088/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=7a7209d7ef275d8105c4f4bcf6e0057a","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=94.026","top_agency_name":"Corporation for National and Community Service","sub_agency_name":"Corporation for National and Community Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Education (13+)","Federal","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Graduate Student","Interstate","Intrastate","Local","Native American Organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","Scientist/Researchers","Sponsored organization","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2190287.0,"usa_spending_actual":8885485.79},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":6770978.36},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":397859.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":491063.36,"obligation":1993020.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"Grantees continue to collect/analyze data and make presentations.
