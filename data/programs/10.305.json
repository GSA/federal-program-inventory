{"id":"10.305","name":"International Science and Education Grants","popular_name":" (ISE)","objective":"The purpose of ISE is to support the internationalization of food, agriculture and related programs at U.S. universities and colleges. It is intended that ISE will improve the ability of American students, business people, and community members to compete more effectively in the global world of agriculture. ISE projects are to strengthen the global competence and competitiveness of American colleges, universities and businesses in the food, agriculture, and related sectors. In addition, ISE projects must be directed to agricultural research, extension, and/or teaching activities that enhance the capabilities of American colleges and universities to conduct international collaborative research, extension and teaching. Our success in the global arena will increasingly require U.S. colleges and universities to produce graduates who can operate competently in domestic and international settings. Through their outreach efforts, universities and colleges also play a critical role in helping U.S. producers successfully operate in foreign markets.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/163cafd38da7492fb2b7a00dcfcdc3ac/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=38f5f9200e2e7bdbb301a492600c4981","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.305","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"National Institute of Food and Agriculture","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-4049.06},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":-4049.06},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Section 229 of the Agricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act of 1998 (AREERA) amended Section 1459 of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (NARETPA) (7 U.S.C.
