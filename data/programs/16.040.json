Lauderdale, FL:  \n\nHate crimes award funding enabled the Broward County State Attorney\u2019s Office to create a Broward County Hate Crimes Task Force with law enforcement and community partners to increase public awareness of hate crimes and provide educational materials and public awareness campaigns to reach at-risk individuals and groups. Work conducted by the task force promotes trust between the community, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system through training and community outreach activities. The task force efforts led to enhanced collaboration and partnerships with community members and criminal justice agencies in neighboring counties, resulting in two partners applying for and receiving BJA grant funds to support their hate crime prevention and response efforts. \n\n Maryland Attorney General\u2019s Office:\n \nFunding from award enabled the site to develop and roll out an online portal, nohomeforhate.md.gov, to provide victims of hate in Maryland an additional avenue to report information about hate crimes and bias incidents, after calling 911.
