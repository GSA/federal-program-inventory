{"id":"10.608","name":"Food for Education","popular_name":"McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Children Nutrition Program","objective":"The key objective of the McGovern-Dole Program is to reduce hunger and improve literacy and primary education, especially for girls. By providing school meals, teacher training and related support, McGovern-Dole projects help boost school enrollment and academic performance. At the same time, the program also focuses on improving children\u2019s health and learning capacity before they enter school by offering nutrition programs for pregnant and nursing women, infants and pre-schoolers. \n\nSustainability is an important aspect of the McGovern-Dole Program. FAS and its partner organizations work to ensure that the communities served by the program can ultimately continue the sponsored activities on their own or with support from other sources such as the host government or local community.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/83c4ea4ac57f4788b431e4deee6e0c88/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=2b143f660379308b9581a33579e00b96","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.608","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Foreign Agricultural Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Child (6-15)","Education (0-8)","Education (9-12)","School"],"applicant_types":["Non-Government - General","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":197000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":370585061.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":248000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":627294952.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":250000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":7511868.48,"obligation":392791626.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":553588387.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2022","description":"55 active projects in 34 countries reached more than 4.7 million children and community members directly in FY2022.
