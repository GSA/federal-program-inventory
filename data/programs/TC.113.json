{"id":"TC.113","name":"Exclusion of employer-provided educational assistance","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income because it represents accretions to wealth that do not materially differ from cash wages. Under current law, however, employer-provided educational assistance is excluded from an employee\u2019s gross income, even though the employer\u2019s costs for this assistance are a deductible business expense. The maximum exclusion is $5,250 per taxpayer. From March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2025 employer-provided student loan payments are considered eligible educational assistance.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1660000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1700000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1820000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
