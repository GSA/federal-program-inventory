{"id":"10.540","name":"Participant Research Innovation Laboratory for Enhancing WIC Services","popular_name":"Hopkins/USDA Participant Research Innovation Laboratory; HPRIL","objective":"The objective of this opportunity was to announce the availability of funds to establish the Participant Research Innovation Laboratory for Enhancing WIC Services. The role of the PRIL is to support and evaluate local efforts to develop interactive tools, technical resources, or innovative solutions that improve customer service in WIC clinics and/or WIC retailers (referred to hereafter as WIC vendors) and ultimately encourage and improve retention of eligible children in WIC. Research projects build on and improve our understanding of the diverse personal experiences, perceptions, and attitudes of those eligible for WIC services. Implemented strategies/solutions will be evaluated for their impact on participant satisfaction and retention, and other relevant measures, within the local agency setting. In addition, the Grantee, Johns Hopkins University, will provide evaluation-related technical assistance to State and local WIC agencies carrying out similar interventions through WIC Special Project Grants or other awards.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/d0e4984cc1d242b8ad7c84a7cd9b41d4/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=da68f6871cfde0326495e8b29d56182a","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.540","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Food and Nutrition Service","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Consumer","Infant (0-5)","Low Income","Women"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":90883.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":5000000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-943.21}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":293664.08,"obligation":5000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"Posted the Grants.gov solicitation on September 2nd; no award made."},{"year":"2018","description":"Revised and reposted the Grants.gov solicitation on May 15, 2018; award anticipated by September 30, 2018."},{"year":"2019","description":"HPRIL completed the Requested for Proposals and made award selections.\n\nHPRIL provided technical assistance to WIC Special Project Grantees.\n\nHPRIL held two advisory panel meetings.\n\nHPRIL will hold a 2 and a half day sub-grantee training workshop from 9/9-9/11."},{"year":"2020","description":"Monthly COIN calls have been occurring with subgrantees.
