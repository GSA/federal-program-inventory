{"id":"10.053","name":"Dairy Indemnity Payment Program","popular_name":"DIPP","objective":"To protect dairy operations and manufacturers of dairy products who through no fault of their own, are directed to remove their milk or dairy products from commercial markets because of contamination from pesticides which have been approved for use by the Federal government. Dairy operations can also be indemnified because of contamination with chemicals or toxic substances, nuclear radiation or fallout. Affected dairy operations provide documentation of the dumped milk losses and are paid through DIPP for the full value of the dumped milk. Additionally,  DIPP has the authority to indemnify cows that are permanently contaminated due to a chemical contamination. DIPP has successfully compensated dairy operations for many decades for dumped milk losses due to contamination issues.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/2d9e7e6d78e94255ab3d965749c7e2c4/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=ce686d51702390e6843ca4e7b9893501","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.053","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Intrastate"],"beneficiary_types":["Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer","Individual/Family","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Profit organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","Small business","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Individual/Family","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":529159.83,"usa_spending_actual":852288.68},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1378280.25,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":500000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":787489.98,"obligation":852288.68},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2023","description":"Provided compensation to affected dairy operations for milk dumped due to contamination.  \n\nProvided compensation for 1 dairy operation to indemnify the contaminated cows affected by a chemical contamination."},{"year":"2024","description":"Provided compensation to affected dairy operations for milk dumped due to contamination."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"7 U.S.C. &sect; 450j-450l.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/7/450"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":0,"rules_regulations":"Program regulations were published in the Federal Register, 7 CFR, 760, and announced through the news media, Handbook 3-LD, and regulations issued by FSA.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
