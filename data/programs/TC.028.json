{"id":"TC.028","name":"Bio-Diesel and small agri-biodiesel producer tax credits","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code allows an income tax credit for biodiesel and for biodiesel derived from virgin sources. In lieu of the biodiesel credit, the taxpayer can claim a refundable excise tax credit. In addition, small agri-biodiesel producers are eligible for a separate income tax credit for biodiesel production, and a separate credit is available for qualified renewable diesel fuel mixtures. This provision expires on December 31, 2024.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":20000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":20000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
