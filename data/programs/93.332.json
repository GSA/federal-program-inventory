This posting reflects a new 5-year funding opportunity, anticipated to start August 27, 2024.  Funded projects will be expected to operate as Navigators year-round, using the funding from CMS to conduct outreach and education in their communities\u2014raising awareness among the remaining uninsured about the coverage options available to them, help consumers find affordable coverage that meets their needs primarily in the Health Insurance Marketplace, and to assist consumers beyond the enrollment process\u2014ensuring they're equipped with the tools and resources needed to utilize and maintain their health coverage all year.\nNavigators are required to provide targeted assistance to underserved and vulnerable populations within the FFE service area (state), which is critical to improving access to health care coverage for communities that have been historically disenfranchised and disproportionately impacted by significant health disparities.  In furtherance of Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, CMS encourages applications from organizations that are members of, or have a history of trusted ties with, the community(ies) and population(s) that they expect to target as Navigators, if awarded.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/6bbc022d58a341f5a0e80c82feea0a49/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=800fd607609dfabe1ef488d4ddcc88a9","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.332","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federal","Local","State"],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public","Indian/Native American Tribal Government (Other than Federally Recognized)","Individual/Family","Other private institutions/organizations","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":98592225.0,"usa_spending_actual":98369644.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":97687240.0,"usa_spending_actual":99915352.23},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":100000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-10215231.42}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":45959851.24,"obligation":100000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Affordable Care Act \u00a7\u00a7 1311(d)(4)(K), 1311(i), and 1321(c)(1); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 155.210 and 155.215.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"For a complete list of requirements, please see the Funding Opportunity that will be posted on https://www.grants.gov.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
