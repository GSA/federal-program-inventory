{"id":"TC.057","name":"Exemption or special alternative tax for small property and casualty insurance companies","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would require corporations to pay taxes on their profits under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Under current law, however, stock non-life insurance companies are generally exempt from tax if their gross receipts for the taxable year do not exceed $600,000 and more than 50 percent of such gross receipts consist of premiums. Mutual non-life insurance companies are generally tax-exempt if their annual gross receipts do not exceed $150,000 and more than 35 percent of gross receipts consist of premiums. Also, non-life insurance companies with no more than a specified level of annual net written premiums generally may elect to pay tax only on their taxable investment income provided certain ownership diversification requirements are met. The underwriting income (premiums, less insurance losses and expenses) of electing companies is excluded from tax. The specified premium limit is indexed for inflation; for 2024, the premium limit is $2.8 million.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1400000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1830000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1880000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
