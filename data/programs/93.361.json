{"id":"93.361","name":"Nursing Research","popular_name":null,"objective":"Nurses understand that improving health and well-being means addressing people\u2019s needs in multiple settings, contexts, and over the life course. NINR-supported science uses nursing\u2019s holistic patient and community-focused perspective and wide reach across clinical and community settings to improve individual and population health by addressing the conditions where people live, learn, work, and play: those factors that are at the root of the health challenges that we see. NINR has a longstanding and continued commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and teams who will carry nursing research into the future.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/30d406a03ad04a2e96a53f36bd033240/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=8289a6214b71923e2838642d573a1dcc","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.361","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"National Institutes of Health","assistance_types":["Project Grants","Project Grants","Training"],"beneficiary_types":["Individual/Family","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Scientist/Researchers","Small business"],"applicant_types":["Federal","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Government - General","Individual/Family","Interstate","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Minority group","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":159425672.0,"usa_spending_actual":153284561.52},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":161259195.0,"usa_spending_actual":153867444.31},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":158418134.0,"usa_spending_actual":22470567.22}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":116150534.48,"obligation":79454982.67},{"x":"2024","outlay":86889580.03,"obligation":47953033.91},{"x":"2025","outlay":32493.59,"obligation":596214.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"246 research grants, 55 NRSA Individual Awards, 152 NRSA Institutional Awards. 250 Research Grants, 47 NRSA Individual Awards, 131 Institutional FTTPs/22 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2017","description":"Projection:\n258 Research Grants, 47 NRSA Individual Awards, 131 Institutional FTTPs/22 Institutional Awards\n\nActuals:\n249 Research Grants, 52 NRSA Individual Awards, 112 Institutional FTTPs/20 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2018","description":"Enacted Projection: 259 Research Grants, 53 NRSA Individual Awards, 114 Institutional FTTPs/20 Institutional Awards;\nActuals:273 Research Grants, 36 NRSA Individual Awards, 115 Institutional FTTPs/19 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2020","description":"301 Research Grants, 36 NRSA Individual Awards, 110 Institutional FTTPs/18 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2021","description":"296 Research Grants, 33 NRSA Individual Awards, 101 Institutional FTTPs/16 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2022","description":"294 Research Grants, 23 Cooperative Agreements, 48 NRSA Individual Awards, 95 Institutional FTTPs/16 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2023","description":"276 Research Grants, 23 Cooperative Agreements, 50 NRSA Individual Awards, 103 Institutional FTTPs/16 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2024","description":"262 Research Grants, 25 Cooperative Agreements, 42 NRSA Individual Awards, 102 Institutional FTTPs/16 Institutional Awards"},{"year":"2025","description":"265 Research Grants, 23 Cooperative Agreements, 50 NRSA Individual Awards, 103 Institutional FTTPs/16 Institutional Awards"}],"authorizations":[{"text":"301, 464, 487, Public Health Service Act. 42 U.S.C. &sect; 285q.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/285"},{"text":"Public Health Service Act.
