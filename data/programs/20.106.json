{"id":"20.106","name":"Airport Improvement Program, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Programs, and COVID-19 Airports Programs","popular_name":"AIP, IIJA, CARES and ARPA","objective":"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has several strategic goals: Safety, People, Global Leadership, and Operational excellence. The FAA Office of Airports (ARP) grant programs described in this listing contribute to these goals, as outlined in the FAA Annual Summary of Performance and Financial Information. \n\nThe ARP mission is planning and developing a safe and efficient national airports system to satisfy the needs of the aviation interests of the U.S., with considerations for economics, environmental issues, local proprietary rights, and safeguarding the public investment. As an important component of that mission, ARP provides financial assistance to airports nationwide through grants. These grants contribute to the objective of maintaining and optimizing airport and runway safety, capacity, efficiency, financial responsibility, and environmental sustainability. The program objective of this listing is to assist sponsors, owners, or operators of public-use airports in the development of a nationwide system of airports adequate to meet the needs of civil aeronautics. \n\nThe purpose of the various laws applicable to this program includes the investment in transportation, environmental protection, and airport infrastructure that will support long-term economic benefits. Grants to airports also support the objectives of several Executive Orders, including Executive Order 14005 \u2013 \u201cEnsuring the Future is Made in all of America by All of America\u2019s Workers\u201d(as listed in the Regulations and Guidance Section). Performance measurement and reporting. An example of performance measurement: In the mission area of safety, the FAA Business Plan has several Initiatives, including the Initiative on Runway Pavement Maintenance. This initiative ensures that airport infrastructure is kept in a safe and serviceable condition through capital improvements and airport inspections. The related activity is to ensure runway pavement is kept in a safe and serviceable condition by maintaining eligible runway pavement in Excellent, Good, or Fair condition. The performance measure, as a specific target metric, is ensuring that this condition is met (based on visual inspections) for 93 percent of the paved runways in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). The financial assistance provided through these federal grants contribute to the capital improvements mentioned above. For performance reporting, all grants are required to submit performance reports (Annually for non-construction grants: FAA Form 5100-140 Performance Report, and quarterly for construction grants: FAA Form 5370-1 Construction Progress and Inspection Report). These reports include reporting on project milestone goals as well as lab and field testing for construction projects. With a standard period of performance of 4 years, projects must be completed within that timeframe. Projects are monitored throughout the period of performance and grant disbursements are regularly tracked. The program office monitors period of performance expirations and grant closeout in order to confirm successful project completion. A key performance indicator for the program in this listing is number of grant projects successfully completed and closed out. This measurement of grant funding disbursement as well as progress of projects towards completion aligns with and is reported on in the FAA\u2019s Annual Performance and Accountability Report.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/3389a9c45a2f4f208ea8d3eaa1f2166c/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=a628a9d763abb88db5ec59c5b7896596","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=20.106","top_agency_name":"Department of Transportation","sub_agency_name":"Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Builder/Contractor/Developer","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local","Major Metropolis (over 250,000)","Other Urban","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","Rural","State","Suburban","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other public institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":["Transportation - Air Transportation"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":7130462298.0,"usa_spending_actual":6956722436.07},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":6853008589.0,"usa_spending_actual":6668216390.73},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":8498137057.0,"usa_spending_actual":346401203.08}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":5022659020.0,"obligation":7136018383.94},{"x":"2024","outlay":1884709400.91,"obligation":6789298569.29},{"x":"2025","outlay":43886338.52,"obligation":504129322.17}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"See Section 170 for Example of Projects  and Programs for 2016.
