{"id":"10.981","name":"Commodity Storage Assistance Program","popular_name":"CSAP","objective":"The Commodity Storage Assistance Program (CSAP) will provide assistance to producers in affected counties that were impacted by eligible disaster events that damaged or destroyed local commercial elevators from December 2021 to December 31, 2024. The CSAP cost-share assistance program is made available to producers to construct on-farm storage structures to support the marketing of the storage limitations in the affected county. CSAP assistance may be available to certain commodity groups nationwide in FSA defined affected counties. CSAP will help producers prepare for the upcoming crop harvest and assist producers who are currently experiencing marketing disruptions and limited storage options due to damaged or destroyed local commercial elevators in their local area. CSAP funds are anticipated to cover a percentage of the eligible expenses associated with purchasing and building on-farm storage capacity in the affected county.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/7d4138e8eb3149afad0ff86df565e45a/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=2edc838282c1d1ff361d775eeede2ba1","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.981","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Profit organization"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Profit organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":140000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"15 U.S.C. &sect; 714c(b).","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/714"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":0,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
