Nearly 600 students across these institutions enrolled in these courses. \n\u2022\tThe Materials Data Science for Stockpile Stewardship Center of Excellence successfully engages a growing network of collaborators at national labs and production facilities, convening teams that include representation from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Kansas City National Security Campus, Argonne National Laboratory, Y-12, and Pantex along with NNSA representatives. Through the Center's charge of supporting the Stockpile Stewardship mission, MDS^3 has achieved notable progress in automated analysis of synchrotron beamline X-ray diffraction datasets, scattering tomography, XRD/XRT imaging, and data analysis related to Laser Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing and Direct Ink Write Printing while developing a powerful new approach to supporting the NNSA's digital transformation through research focused on data governance and stewardship."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"2 CFR 200, Federal Statutes, OMB Circulars, and other Government-wide guidance implementing 2 CFR 200, DOE Acquisition Policy and Guidance, DOE Guide to Financial Assistance.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
