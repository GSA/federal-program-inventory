In addition, the program allowed students who were already enrolled at grantee, the opportunity to earn a certificate in FTE, a program that helps develop their skills to be flight test-ready engineers upon graduation and to increase their readiness to enter the DON STEM workforce.\n\nBy the completion of the program, the grantee had met all their program goals, resulting in 281 K-12 students being inspired, 190 undergraduate students being flown in FTE aircraft, 8 Senior Design projects funded, 32 new enrollments at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station (Pax NAS) Education Center, and numerous students with STEM degrees from grantee. The program also included uniformed members of Navy and current Navy civilians as successful recipients of the M.S. degree in FTE and the FTE certificate. In addition, a number of students selected civilian and contractor DON STEM careers including working at or in support of Pax NAS."},{"year":"2022","description":"Our materials provide solutions to these challenges by taking students through an engaging series of lessons packaged with characters \u2018Slybert\u2019 and \u2018Cybert\u2019 an antagonist and protagonist modeling how to identify and prevent threats in cyber that they or their families and friends may experience.
