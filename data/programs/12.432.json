Rapidly modifying geometries for device testing can be streamlined by using additive manufacturing; however, additive manufacturing often results in rough surfaces, which in turn can affect flow dynamics. Flow within the interior of devices has long been measured utilizing particle image velocity (PIV); however, complex device geometries often make experimental setups for PIV prohibitively difficult. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a powerful technology for characterizing 3D flow fields in complex geometries as well as multiphase flows."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.","url":null},{"text":"10 U.S.C. &sect; 7462.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/10/7462"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
