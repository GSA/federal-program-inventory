{"id":"19.121","name":"Conflict and Stabilization Operations","popular_name":"CSO","objective":"The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) is part of the Under Secretariat for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights (J) within the Department of State (DOS). CSO's mission is to strengthen U.S. national security by breaking cycles of violent conflict and mitigating crisis in priority countries. Guided by local dynamics, CSO acts quickly to devise sustainable solutions to address the full spectrum of conflict, from prevention to crisis response to stabilization. Building more effective partnerships with capable implementing organizations with experience in conflict prevention and stabilization activities is integral to the CSO mission and as such, CSO seeks to identify qualified partners, facilitators and implementers from among private and nonprofit entities. Funding may be made available for flexible, rapid, targeted, and high-impact awards to organizations to prevent, mitigate and/or respond to conflict situations and stabilize\r\ncountries around the world.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/021ea840f5334f288433cb68e37e8674/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=0bc2b8277f8bc62863e7d1397ee8d498","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=19.121","top_agency_name":"Department of State","sub_agency_name":"Department of State","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Child (6-15)","Disabled (e.g. Deaf, Blind, Physically Disabled)","Education Professional","Health Professional","Minority group","Other public institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Scientist/Researchers","Small Business Person","Small business","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","Student/Trainee","Women","Youth (16-21)"],"applicant_types":["Minority group","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":3012789.91},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":7198200.62},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":2518340.01}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":1772058.8},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":4414587.5},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":2466250.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"In FY2016, CSO issued 18 federal assistance awards focused in regions all across the globe.
