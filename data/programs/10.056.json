{"id":"10.056","name":"Farm Storage Facility Loans","popular_name":"FSFL","objective":"The Farm Storage Facility Loan (FSFL) Program provides low-interest financing for producers to build, upgrade, or acquire farm storage and handling facilities, storage and handling equipment and trucks. The following commodities are eligible for on-farm storage, drying and handling equipment: corn, grain sorghum, rice, soybeans, oats, peanuts, wheat, barley, or minor oilseeds harvested as whole grain; corn, grain sorghum, wheat, oats or barley harvested as other-than-whole grain; pulse crops (lentils, chickpeas and dry peas); hay; honey; renewable biomass; fruits (includes nuts) and vegetables - cold storage facilities; aquaculture (excluding systems that maintain live animals through uptake and discharge of water); floriculture; hops; milk; rye; meat and poultry (unprocessed); eggs; cheese, butter and yogurt. The loan must be approved by the local FSA state or county committee before any site preparation, construction, and/or acquisition can be started. All loan requests are subject to an environmental evaluation. Accepting delivery of equipment, starting any site preparation, or construction before loan approval, may impede the successful completion of an environmental evaluation and may adversely affect loan eligibility.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/d21a0f045a3546a58da13ac503aa23d5/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=86198da27b4bc412fec3270eb94eb119","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.056","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer","Individual/Family","Land/Property Owner"],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public","Individual/Family"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":333356000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":312094000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":540000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":889921.24,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":61962.81,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":6875.11,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"Since 2000, 59,464 FSFLs have been disbursed totaling $4.3 billion and  loan terms range from 3 to 12 years.
