{"id":"16.710","name":"Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Grants","popular_name":"COPS Office","objective":"The COPS Office was established in 1994 to assist state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies in enhancing effectiveness and building the capacity to advance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies.  Community policing entails developing partnerships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve so they can work collaboratively to resolve problems and build community trust.  It is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem solving techniques, in order to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, fear of crime, and satisfaction with police services. Community policing is comprised of three key components:\r\n\r\nCommunity Partnerships\r\nCollaborative partnerships between the law enforcement agency and the individuals and organizations they serve to develop solutions to problems and increase trust in police: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tOther government agencies \r\n\u2022\tCommunity members/groups \r\n\u2022\tNonprofits/service providers \r\n\u2022\tPrivate businesses \r\n\u2022\tMedia\t\r\n\r\nOrganizational Transformation\r\nThe alignment of organizational management, structure, personnel, and information systems to support community partnerships and proactive problem solving:\r\n      \r\n\u2022\tAgency management \r\n\u2022\tClimate and culture \r\n\u2022\tLeadership \r\n\u2022\tLabor relations \r\n\u2022\tDecision-making \r\n\u2022\tStrategic planning \r\n\u2022\tPolicies \r\n\u2022\tOrganizational evaluations \r\n\u2022\tTransparency \r\n\u2022\tOrganizational structure\r\n\u2022\tGeographic assignment of officers \r\n\u2022\tDespecialization \r\n\u2022\tResources and finances\r\n\u2022\tPersonnel \r\n\u2022\tRecruitment, hiring, and selection \r\n\u2022\tPersonnel supervision/evaluations \r\n\u2022\tTraining\r\n\u2022\tInformation systems (Technology) \r\n\u2022\tCommunication/access to data \r\n\u2022\tQuality and accuracy of data\r\n\r\nProblem Solving\r\nThe process of engaging in the proactive and systematic examination of identified problems to develop and rigorously evaluate effective responses:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tScan: Identify and prioritize problems \r\n\u2022\tAnalysis: Research what is known about the problem \r\n\u2022\tResponse: Develop solutions to bring about lasting reductions in the number        and                extent of problems \r\n\u2022\tAssessment: Evaluate the success of the responses \r\n\u2022\tUse the crime triangle to focus on immediate conditions (victim/offender/location)\r\n","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/bcfe86d58c1085223a127cee3d5d25ad/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=3adcc2ed4d4f6cca03358a36588135f5","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.710","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Boards and Divisions Offices","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local","Native American Organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":513701374.09},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":1029213389.6},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":16155235.96}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":288225789.87,"obligation":516322031.64},{"x":"2024","outlay":202061847.18,"obligation":1030403137.6},{"x":"2025","outlay":483747.46,"obligation":18890099.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 3796dd, as amended; Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Title I, Part Q, Public Law 103-322.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Application Guides and current edition of M7100.1, which are available from Headquarters.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
