{"id":"10.332","name":"Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative","popular_name":"Genome to Phenome","objective":"The National Institute of Food and Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative (AG2PI) program focuses on collaborative science engagement that brings together a community of researchers across both crops and animals to lay the foundation for expanding knowledge concerning genomes and phenomes of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States. Applications that propose a collaboration among U.S. crop and animal researchers are encouraged. In FY 2022, Congress recognized the value of leading public and land-grant universities with unique high-throughput phenotyping and greenhouse facilities and expertise for plant science innovation, root and rhizome innovation, and food for health. Congress provided funding for the Genome to Phenome program and encouraged NIFA to support the development of tools and datasets that can be used across multiple crop species to develop advanced genome engineering tools for integrated optimization of crop yield and animal feed for improved animal reproduction and nutrition and to mitigate environmental impacts from crop and animal production.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/119d044f5ee94b89a2d35d55d1c368a8/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=7655d4edd78dd7e45f0a8dc11ccbad2a","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.332","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"National Institute of Food and Agriculture","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federal","Individual/Family","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Small business (less than 500 employees)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2308369.0,"usa_spending_actual":2307259.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1855844.0,"usa_spending_actual":1857553.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-24602.91}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":562333.23,"obligation":2307259.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":116347.43,"obligation":1857553.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2023","description":"For FY23 AG2PI received 8 proposals and 2 awards were made."},{"year":"2024","description":"For FY24 AG2PI received 23 proposals and 3 awards were made."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"7 U.S.C. &sect; 5924.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/7/5924"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"NIFA works in partnership with grantees to ensure responsible stewardship of federal funds.
