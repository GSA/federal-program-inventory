This program provides support and guidance for carrying out the expenditure of appropriated funds generated from the sale of public lands in Lincoln and White Pine Counties in eastern Nevada.  A primary goal of this program is to carry out the inventory, evaluation, protection, and management of unique archeological resources and also encompasses recreation improvements and wildlife habitat. The program will focus funded partnerships on key activities in support of the Department of the Interior's priorities.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/653d1cb0d4b5457aafea5e5d62f2597e/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=59e82395892460d24e7c26c53da72121","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.017","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":439818.0,"usa_spending_actual":439818.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":200000.0,"usa_spending_actual":500033.15}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":339456.76,"obligation":469239.6},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":18172.89,"obligation":470611.55}],"results":[{"year":"2020","description":"Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene Landscape use in Coal Valley, Basin and Range National Monument, Lincoln County, Nevada \nThe Desert Research Institute (DRI) constructed an archaeological context of landscape use and subsistence practices in Coal Valley during the late Pleistocene to middle Holocene."},{"year":"2021","description":"In FY 2021 a recipient of LCAI funding closed out a Nevada State Parks project. The Nevada Site Stewardship Program (NSSP), managed by the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), worked closely with Nevada State Parks to enhance archaeological resource management and public engagement. This was accomplished by developing and improving the knowledge, skills, and tools needed for State Parks to manage, protect, and preserve their archaeological resources while also providing opportunities for public education and participation in cultural resource preservation at State Parks in Lincoln County. NSSP approached this goal by focusing efforts in three areas. First, NSSP educated State Parks and the community about State Parks\u2019 archaeological resources through the creation of a comprehensive overview document which places the resources within the history and prehistory of the County and a brochure for the public highlighting archaeological resources at the parks and their preservation. Second, NSSP trained State Park staff on how to identify cultural resources on State Park lands, engage with the public to encourage an appreciation for the local archaeology, and provide a process for the public to report when they discover new resources. Lastly, NSSP assisted State Parks in setting up archaeological sites for volunteer site stewardship and advised them in creating a system for managing archaeological information and stewardship reports."},{"year":"2022","description":"In FY 2022, recipients of LCAI funding expect to close 2 projects approved in previous years. 4 other projects scheduled to close are in the process of requesting 1 year extensions."},{"year":"2023","description":"BLM entered into two agreements to encourage the inventory, evaluation, and protection of unique archaeological resources in Lincoln County, Nevada. Projects included partnerships with the State Historic Preservation Office to improve the Lincoln County Site Stewardship Program and with The Nevada State Parks to improve preservation techniques for three historic ranches in Spring Valley State Park.\n\nOther projects awarded in previous years were also completed in FY23. For example, the Archaeology and Geomorphology Green Box project provided teachers for grades 6-8 active learning strategies to engage students in hands-on projects that foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The Green Boxes are now available to teachers in Lincoln County and other schools to check-out and use during the semester to facilitate cultural resource education in the future. Another example of projects that were completed is the Lincoln County High project. The project inventoried cultural resources above 8,000 feet, Lincoln County High provides researchers site records that record game drives, cairns, and hunting blinds that document Native American hunting activities."},{"year":"2024","description":"Unknown at this time."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 Section 307(b) (FLPMA) 43 U.S.C. &sect; 1737 (b).","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"All guidance for this program rests with the Lincoln County Land Act of 2000, Public Law 106-298; the Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation, and Development of 2004, Public Law 108-424, and the White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2006, Public Law 109-432.
