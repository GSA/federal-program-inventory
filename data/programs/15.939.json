{"id":"15.939","name":"Heritage Partnership","popular_name":"National Heritage Areas","objective":"The purpose of the Heritage Partnership Program funding is to carry out programs and projects that engage National Heritage Area (NHA) recipients, partners, communities, and/or visitors in shared environmental stewardship.  It promotes greater public and private participation in preservation, conservation, education, and outdoor recreation programs and activities, and builds resource stewardship ethics in is participants.  Goals for each National Heritage Area are set forth in each of their designation legislation, but in general, the goal of designation as a National Heritage Area is to preserve and interpret for the educational and inspirational benefit of present and future generations the unique and significant contributions to our national heritage.  This heritage is shown through certain historic and cultural lands, waterways, and structures. By preserving and interpreting this heritage, NHAs are able to encourage a broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality of life within the designated area, and provide a management framework to assist state/local government entities, non-profits, and others in developing policies and programs that will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, historical, natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the heritage area.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/aa97a4c081ed4a4596ec1735ee8d389e/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=314d7e9002f0eba0b479cf21516668d8","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.939","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"National Park Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Public nonprofit institution/organization"],"applicant_types":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":29243071.0,"usa_spending_actual":29211630.86},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":29000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":28773331.47},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":3788321.51}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":16192031.8,"obligation":18337648.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":10961695.75,"obligation":17664040.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":111000.0,"obligation":1882000.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"No information available.
