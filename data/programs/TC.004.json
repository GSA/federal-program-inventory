{"id":"TC.004","name":"Reduced tax rate on active income of controlled foreign corporations (normal tax method)","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, worldwide income forms the tax base of U.S. corporations. In contrast, U.S. tax law exempts or preferentially taxes certain portions of this income. Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA (effective January 1, 2018), active foreign income was generally taxed only upon repatriation. TCJA changed these rules, so that certain active income (called \u201cglobal intangible low tax income\u201d or \u201cGILTI\u201d) is taxed currently, even if it is not distributed. However, U.S. corporations generally receive a 50 percent deduction from U.S. tax on their GILTI (the deduction decreases to 37.5 percent in 2026), resulting in a substantially reduced rate of tax. In addition, some active income is excluded from tax, and distributions out of active income are no longer taxed upon repatriation. These reductions and exemptions from U.S. taxation are considered tax expenditures.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - International Affairs"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":45190000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":36060000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":37140000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
