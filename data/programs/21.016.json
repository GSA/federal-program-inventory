{"id":"21.016","name":"Equitable  Sharing ","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Department of the Treasury Asset Forfeiture Program is a nationwide law enforcement initiative that removes the tools of crime from criminal organizations, deters crime and deprives wrongdoers of the proceeds of their criminal proceeds, and recovers property that may be used to compensate victims. \r\n\r\nEquitable sharing further enhances the law enforcement mission by fostering cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  Federal law authorizes Treasury to share federally forfeited property with participating state and local law enforcement agencies.  Equitable sharing is discretionary and limited by statute.   \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of the Justice  administers a similar program.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/ddbb3be58e2749269b78e5bf4cdbba25/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=ba1e45ed1b34ffdad5b2bd8f9da025be","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=21.016","top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":["Federal","Local","State"],"applicant_types":["Federal","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":120000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":177620000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":75300000.0,"usa_spending_actual":9144703.32}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":9144703.32}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. 31 U.S.C. &sect; 9705.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/31/9705"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Guide to Equitable Sharing For State, Local, and Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies dated July 2018\n\nDepartment of the Treasury Assistance Listing 21.016 \nEquitable Sharing Program Compliance Supplement","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
