For example, grantees coordinate information sharing and meetings between various members of the community to not only identify a potential sign of radicalization to violence, but also to determine how to best handle the case who is best to handle the \ncase. So far 56 cases have been referred to the appropriate TA member and 94 cases have been intervened successfully.  \nFurthermore, so far FY 20 and FY 21 grantees have trained more than 5,000 individuals on topics such as Targeted Violence: Community Awareness, Behavioral Analysis, and Prevention Strategies, media literacy, and youth leadership, among others."},{"year":"2023","description":"\u2022\t109 awards have been award across the TVTP Grant Program to date (29 in FY20, 43 in FY21 and 37 in FY22)\n\u2022\tA geographically diverse selection of grantees has been made across the FY20, FY21, and FY22 grant cycles, reaching 33 unique states and the District of Columbia.
