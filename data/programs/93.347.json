{"id":"93.347","name":"Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) Recognized Coordinating Entity (RCE) Cooperative Agreement","popular_name":"TEFCA RCE Cooperative Agreement","objective":"The purpose of this program is to support efforts to advance the establishment of an interoperable health system that (1) empowers individuals to use their electronic health information to the fullest extent (2) enables providers and communities to deliver smarter, safer, and more efficient care, and (3) promotes innovation at all levels. The Draft Trusted Exchange Framework, released on January 5, 2018, advances the goals of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) to advance nationwide interoperability by creating a common set of principles, terms, and conditions that facilitate trust between health information networks (HINs). \n\nThe Draft Trusted Exchange Framework contains two parts: Part A\u2014Principles for Trusted Exchange and Part B\u2014Minimum Required Terms and Conditions for Trusted Exchange. Part A provides guard rails and general principles that HINs  and Qualified HINs  should follow to engender trust amongst Participants and End Users. Part B provides specific minimum required terms and conditions to be included into a single Common Agreement by a RCE. ONC will review comments received on Part A and Part B to develop a final Trusted Exchange Framework that the RCE would assist in implementing. \n\nPart B of the Draft Trusted Exchange Framework is not intended to be an all-encompassing participation agreement, but rather includes provisions to address identified areas of variation across existing network agreements. This funding opportunity announcement seeks to identify a single RCE that will \u2013 in collaboration with ONC \u2013 incorporate the final Part B requirements into a single Common Agreement to which Qualified HINs and their Participants may voluntarily agree to adhere. Development of a single, all-encompassing agreement that is nationwide in scope will significantly reduce the need for one-off or point-to-point interfaces, which are costly, complex to create and maintain, and an inefficient use of provider and health IT developer resources.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/6c008360d22547569b2d5d528a44aa2f/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=f284582bd73d2f3515cafa79cdd94100","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.347","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Office of the Secretary","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"21st Century CURES Act, Division A, Title IV - Delivery, 4003 - Interoperability.","url":null},{"text":"HR 6157 - Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019.
