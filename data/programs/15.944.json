To carry out and further this stewardship responsibility, the NPS implements programs that encompass a broad range of research, operational, and educational activities.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/7cae3542d9334a3bb984cc0447923b01/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=b820e040f1a154d4e255be1b29868d5b","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.944","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"National Park Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Individual/Family","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Sponsored organization","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":21086654.0,"usa_spending_actual":21029849.29},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":11075685.0,"usa_spending_actual":21850605.65},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":15000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":17323917.92}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":11242801.85,"obligation":23557625.53},{"x":"2024","outlay":3038266.56,"obligation":13453066.94},{"x":"2025","outlay":456727.3,"obligation":10635710.76}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":" No information available.
