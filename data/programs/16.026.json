{"id":"16.026","name":"OVW Research and Evaluation Program","popular_name":"R&E","objective":"The purpose of the Research and Evaluation (R&E) Program is to further develop and make maximum use of the evidence base for approaches to combatting domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. By generating more knowledge about strategies for serving victims and holding offenders accountable, communities that benefit from VAWA funding will be better equipped to align their work with practices that are known to be effective, and they will be more capable of generating empirical knowledge on the efficacy of new and promising ways of doing things. Because OVW has very limited funds to support research and evaluation, this program prioritizes topics for which a stronger evidence base would help OVW grantees use federal funds most effectively.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/0f825e4e05a44894843d1e3ff089bd6b/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=dd4ce5cbf3eac7bbfbfe0af40e829681","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.026","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Boards and Divisions Offices","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Health Professional","Local","Minority group","Native American Organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Scientist/Researchers","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3140580.0,"usa_spending_actual":5740580.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":8188113.0,"usa_spending_actual":3600000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3400000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":3322395.09,"obligation":5740580.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":115791.67,"obligation":3600000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Violence Against Women Act, as amended.
