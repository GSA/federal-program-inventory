{"id":"10.606","name":"Food for Progress","popular_name":"FFPr","objective":"In order to use the food resources of the United States more effectively in support of developing countries, and countries that are emerging democracies that have made commitments to introduce or expand free enterprise elements in their agricultural economies through changes in commodity pricing, marketing, input availability, distribution, and private sector involvement, Food for Progress (FFPr) furnishes agricultural commodities to those countries, which are then sold. The proceeds from those sales is used to provide technical assistance intended to improve agricultural productivity in those countries, and to expand trade of agricultural products to, from, and within those countries.\n\nProgram effectiveness is tracked against 24 standard indicators relating to increased agricultural productivity, improved land and water resource quality, use of financial services, institutional capacity, leverage of private sector resources, post-harvest infrastructure, and expansion of agricultural trade.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/505286a5f32a47e5a32efd3bc3a7db8a/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=d99fde018384f8807333bb49105d90d7","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.606","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Foreign Agricultural Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer","Land/Property Owner","Minority group","Other public institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Rural","Small Business Person","Small business","State"],"applicant_types":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other private institutions/organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":225080000.0,"usa_spending_actual":130032040.65},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":218500000.0,"usa_spending_actual":16927157.54},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":230000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":31392529.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":130032040.65},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":16927157.54},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":31392529.0}],"results":[{"year":"2022","description":"More than 317,000 individuals applied improved technologies or management practices on more than 681,000 hectares of land."},{"year":"2023","description":"During FY 2023, activities conducted by active projects reached more than 662,000 direct participants.
