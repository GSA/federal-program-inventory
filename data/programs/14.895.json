{"id":"14.895","name":"Jobs-Plus Pilot Initiative","popular_name":"Jobs-Plus Iniative","objective":"The Jobs Plus program develops locally based, job-driven approaches that increase earnings and advance employment outcomes through work readiness, employer linkages, job placement, educational advancement, technology skills, and financial literacy for residents of public housing. The place-based Jobs Plus program addresses poverty among public housing residents by incentivizing and enabling employment through earned income disregards for working residents and a set of services designed to support work including employer linkages, job placement and counseling, educational advancement, and financial counseling. Ideally, these incentives will saturate the target public housing development, building a culture of work and making working residents the norm. The Jobs Plus program model comprises these three core components: Employment-Related Services; Financial/Rent Incentive \u2013 Jobs Plus Earned Income Disregard (JPEID); and Community Supports for Work.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/e6004933d1a94d82a3f5c6debac66300/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=317ce0c87fe2687ef52484a7fa654d0f","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=14.895","top_agency_name":"Department of Housing and Urban Development","sub_agency_name":"Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Local","Low Income","State","U.S. Citizen","Unemployed"],"applicant_types":["Government - General","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":9199059.0,"usa_spending_actual":39690074.99},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":30934403.0,"usa_spending_actual":69718825.79},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":15000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":36648437.53}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":22625648.67,"obligation":39690074.99},{"x":"2024","outlay":10567031.2,"obligation":69964675.79},{"x":"2025","outlay":1318984.43,"obligation":36648437.53}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"The Department will provide 8-9 grants for this program.
