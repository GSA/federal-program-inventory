{"id":"20.516","name":"Job Access and Reverse Commute Program","popular_name":"JARC","objective":"This program continues to be repealed. On October 1, 2013, the Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) Program was repealed by Congress under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).  \n\nThe JARC Program provided grants to local governments, nonprofit organizations, and designated recipients of Federal transit funding to develop transportation services to connect welfare recipients and low- income persons to employment and support services. Job Access grants finance planning, capital and operating cost of projects. The Reverse Commute grants assist in funding the costs associated with adding reverse commute bus, train, carpool or service from urban areas, urban, rural and other suburban locations to suburban work places. Projects meeting these objectives are now eligible for funding under Section 5307 and 5311.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/493fa51d444b4620b2a5674386c99a0d/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=186bf48096402fb72afab5f77c8e8bac","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=20.516","top_agency_name":"Department of Transportation","sub_agency_name":"Federal Transit Administration (FTA)","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Local","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":["Transportation - Ground Transportation"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-3311706.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-358638.73},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-389643.25}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":3376003.0,"obligation":-3311695.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":3557725.0,"obligation":-358638.73},{"x":"2025","outlay":2211074.75,"obligation":-389643.25}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"It is anticipated that previously- funded JARC projects will continue, and new services enabling low-income people access to job opportunites may be funded through Sections 5311 and 5307.
