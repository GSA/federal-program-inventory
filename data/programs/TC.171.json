{"id":"TC.171","name":"Exclusion of interest on public purpose State and local bonds","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low (or zero) tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. In contrast, under current law the interest earned on State and local government bonds issued to finance public purpose construction (e.g., schools, roads, sewers), equipment acquisition, and other public purposes is tax-exempt. The interest on bonds issued by Indian tribal governments for essential governmental purposes is also tax-exempt.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - General Purpose Fiscal Assistance"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":29810000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":39920000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":41110000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
