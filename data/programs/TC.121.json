{"id":"TC.121","name":"Adoption credit and exclusion","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities. In contrast, taxpayers can receive a tax credit for qualified adoption expenses under current law. Taxpayers may also exclude qualified adoption expenses provided or reimbursed by an employer from income, subject to the same maximum amounts and phaseout as the credit. The same expenses cannot qualify for tax benefits under both programs; however, a taxpayer may use the benefits of the exclusion and the tax credit for different expenses.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":870000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":300000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":390000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
