{"id":"TC.102","name":"Disaster employee retention credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code provides employers located in certain presidentially declared disaster areas during the years 2017 through 2020 a 40 percent credit for up to $6,000 in wages paid to each eligible employee while the business was inoperable as a result of the disaster. Only wages paid after the disaster occurred and within 150 days of the last day of the incident period are eligible for the credit. Employers must reduce their deduction for wages paid by the amount of the credit claimed.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Community and Regional Development"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":50000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":40000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":40000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
