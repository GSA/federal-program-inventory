{"id":"15.987","name":"Good Neighbor Authority for Restoration","popular_name":"Good Neighbor Authority","objective":"The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) is intended to expand limited federal capacity to implement and plan forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration projects by facilitating partnerships with authorized states, counties, and federally recognized Indian tribes. The GNA authority specifically allows the National Park Service (NPS) to enhance state-federal relationships and address cross-boundary land restoration needs. This includes activities such as treating insect-and-disease-infested trees; reducing hazardous fuels; and any other activities to restore or improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health, including fish and wildlife habitat. This type of work reduces wildfire risk to habitat, communities, and state trust lands; creates greater forest and watershed resilience against drought, insects, disease, and wildfire; and expands much-needed work across state and federal lands.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/63304967c665401a9e74166224005189/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=2fdcd38f08bf7a2f95e9c1763063aeb5","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.987","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"National Park Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2025","description":"This is a new program and projects have not yet been selected or funded, but projects will meet the requirements of the legislation."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Good Neighbor Authority U.S.C. &sect; 16 US Code \u00a72113a.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
