{"id":"66.488","name":"Midsize and Large Drinking Water System Infrastructure Resilience and Sustainability Program \u2013 Safe Drinking Water Act 1459F","popular_name":null,"objective":"The purpose of this grant program is to increase drinking water system resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events and reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Grant funding can be used to assist in the planning, design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or project that increases resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events or reduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Funding priority is for projects that increase drinking water system resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events or reduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities in public water systems that serve a community with a population of 10,000 or more. Eligible activities for funding include planning, design, construction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of a program or project that increases resilience to natural hazards and extreme weather events, or reduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities, through: (1) the conservation of water or the enhancement of water-use efficiency; (2) the modification or relocation of existing drinking water system infrastructure made, or that is at risk of being, significantly impaired by natural hazards or extreme weather events, including risks to drinking water from flooding; (3) the design or construction of new or modified desalination facilities to serve existing communities; (4) the enhancement of water supply through the use of watershed management and source water protection; (5) the enhancement of energy efficiency or the use and generation of renewable energy in the conveyance or treatment of drinking water;\n(6) the development and implementation of measures- (A) to increase the resilience of the eligible entity to natural hazards and extreme weather events; or (B) to reduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities; (7) the conservation of water or the enhancement of a water supply through the implementation of water reuse measures; or (8) the formation of regional water partnerships to collaboratively address documented water shortages.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/4f6c998ce91243fa9da87b6827510fed/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=337b77b0a0e6b13e59d3d287e907c631","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=66.488","top_agency_name":"Environmental Protection Agency","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Other public institution/organization"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":12250000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), 1459F.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Assistance agreement awards are subject to the grant regulations at 2 CFR Part 1500 (EPA Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards)","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
