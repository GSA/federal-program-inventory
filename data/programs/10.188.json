By investing in certified organic, expanding capacity for aggregation, processing, manufacturing, storing, transporting, wholesaling, distribution, or consumer markets, the anticipated increase in market activity will both address demand for domestically produced agricultural products and the critical need for additional market paths identified by domestic organic producers.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/93427c5ced4641b6a4530c3a6248d81c/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=bd65106d04f7fb3c1955dc23b29cb1b8","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.188","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Agricultural Marketing Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["American Indian","Anyone/general public","Asian","Black","Consumer","Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local","Low Income","Major Metropolis (over 250,000)","Migrant","Minority group","Moderate Income","Native American Organizations","Other Non-White","Other Urban","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Refugee/Alien","Rural","School","Small Business Person","Small business","Spanish Origin","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Suburban","U.S. Citizen","Women"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Profit organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":75000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":85000000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":25016653.56,"obligation":85000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"A total of 107 projects were awarded in 37 states.
