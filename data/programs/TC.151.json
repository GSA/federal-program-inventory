{"id":"TC.151","name":"Net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings: Individual Retirement Accounts","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers can take advantage of traditional and Roth IRAs to defer or otherwise reduce the tax on the return to their retirement savings. The IRA contribution limit is $7,000 in 2024; taxpayers age 50 or over are allowed to make additional \u201ccatch-up\u2019\u2019 contributions of $1,000. Contributions to a traditional IRA are generally deductible but the deduction is phased out for workers with incomes above certain levels if the workers or their spouses are active participants in an employer-provided retirement plan. Contributions and account earnings are includible in income when withdrawn from traditional IRAs. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but earnings and withdrawals are exempt from taxation. Income limits also apply to Roth IRA contributions.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Income Security"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":32690000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":33550000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":35110000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
