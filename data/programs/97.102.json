{"id":"97.102","name":"Case Management Pilot Program","popular_name":"Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP)","objective":"The objective of the Case Management Pilot Program (CMPP) is to ensure that noncitizens engaged in immigration removal proceedings and enrolled in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Alternatives to Detention program have access to legal information and other critical services. CMPP service providers will provide case management, trafficking screening, legal orientation programs, and, as needed, mental health services, cultural orientation programs, connection to social services, and departure planning and reintegration services to noncitizens in immigration removal proceedings. The CMPP will enable the Department to determine whether CMPP services, delivered by nonprofits and/or local governments and overseen and managed by a National Board, are efficacious. For these purposes, efficacious means promoting compliance with immigration legal obligations, efficiencies within the immigration legal process, and other factors that are important for humanitarian reasons, including identifying victims of human trafficking and individuals potentially eligible for immigration relief.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/5911be30bcdb484c9c30694641e2ed79/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=8e69efb393935643086af103b23b04c3","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.102","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Sponsored organization"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":15000000.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":15000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":20000000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-32201306.15}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":3336894.73,"obligation":3336894.73},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub.
