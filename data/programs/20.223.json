{"id":"20.223","name":"Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Program","popular_name":"TIFIA Credit Program","objective":"To finance projects of national or regional significance by filling market gaps and leveraging substantial non-Federal and private co-investment.  Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) credit assistance is intended to facilitate the financing of projects that would otherwise have been significantly delayed because of funding limitations or difficulties accessing the capital markets.  Through TIFIA, the USDOT provides Federal credit assistance to eligible highway, transit, rail, and intermodal freight projects, including access to seaports. \n\nThe Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST), enacted in December 2015, authorized the establishment of a Regional Infrastructure Accelerator Demonstration Program (the Program) to assist entities in developing improved infrastructure priorities and financing strategies for the accelerated development of a project that is eligible for funding under the TIFIA Program.
