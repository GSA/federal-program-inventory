{"id":"TC.035","name":"Credit for construction of new energy efficient homes","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code allowed contractors a tax credit of $2,000 for the construction of a qualified new energy-efficient home that had an annual level of heating and cooling energy consumption at least 50 percent below the annual consumption under the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code. The credit equaled $1,000 in the case of a new manufactured home that met a 30 percent standard or requirements for EPA\u2019s Energy Star homes. This provision expired on December 31, 2017, but it was increased up to $5,000 and extended to homes acquired in 2023 through 2032.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":280000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":210000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":220000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
