{"id":"10.854","name":"Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants","popular_name":"(REDLG)","objective":"The Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Programs provide funding for rural projects through local utility organizations. USDA provides zero-interest loans to local utilities which they, in turn, pass through to local businesses (ultimate recipients) for projects that will create and retain employment in rural areas. The ultimate recipients repay the lending utility directly. The utility then is responsible for repayment to USDA.\n\nUSDA provides grants to local utility organizations which use the funding to establish Revolving Loan Funds (RLF). Loans are made from the revolving loan funds to projects that will create or retain rural jobs. When the revolving loan fund is terminated, the grant is repaid to USDA.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/a3db0c87fbe14979bc7032ba9c4f8eaa/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=0cbddf88c9994f3fe449a5a7c34eca28","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.854","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Rural Business-Cooperative Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Local","Rural"],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other private institutions/organizations","Profit organization","Sponsored organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":133905502.0,"usa_spending_actual":9353740.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":65040498.0,"usa_spending_actual":8532689.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":12221861.0,"usa_spending_actual":4498346.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":17804341.78,"obligation":9353740.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":11175586.68,"obligation":8532689.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":1590500.0,"obligation":4498346.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"7 RED grants were awarded in FY24 Q3 for $2,100,000.00."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, Title III, 7 U.S.C. 930-940c.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
