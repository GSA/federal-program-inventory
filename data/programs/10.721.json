Temporary bridge programs include fee rental, no-cost rental, and rent-to-own programs which are designed to make temporary bridges available to loggers, contractors, and State and Tribal operators for crossing watercourses during forest management operations.  These programs use temporary bridges in place of constructing temporary \u201cford\u201d crossings or installing temporary culverts to cross watercourses, protecting streambanks and improving water quality.  Temporary bridges may be reused and allow for normal streamflow, making these programs more cost effective than constructing ford crossings or installing temporary culverts, and provide improved access for forest management activities, particularly following rain events or in sensitive watersheds."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"16 USC U.S.C. &sect; 6592(b)(5).","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
