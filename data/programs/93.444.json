{"id":"93.444","name":"Tribal Self-Governance Program: Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreement","popular_name":"(Tribal Self Governance)","objective":"To enable Federally recognized Indian tribes to enter into agreements that would allow them to assume programs, services, functions, and activities (PSFA) (or portions thereof) that the IHS would otherwise provide for Indians because of their status as Indians. To accomplish this objective, the Indian Health Service (IHS) offers Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreements each year for: (1) additional tribes interested in participating in the IHS Tribal Self-Governance Program, and (2) existing Self-Governance Tribes that would like to plan for the assumption of new and/or expanded programs. The Planning Cooperative Agreements allow Tribes to gather information to determine the current types and extent of PSFA and funding levels available within its service areas and to plan for the types and extent of PSFA and funding to be made available to the tribe under a compact. The Negotiation Cooperative Agreements provide Tribes with additional funding to defray costs involved in and preparing to negotiate Self-Governance compacts pursuant to Title V of the ISDEAA.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/14f35af15700462db2cee928d659cfe8/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=72f33e3894df41a3d38b937872c1dcf8","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.444","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Indian Health Service","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["American Indian","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Native American Organizations"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-326802.94},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1068000.0,"usa_spending_actual":1068000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1584000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-1644.99}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":91721.0,"obligation":-44215.72},{"x":"2024","outlay":375450.89,"obligation":1068000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 458aaa-2(e)-(f); 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 137.24-26.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 458aaa-2(e)-(f); 42 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 137.24-26.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
