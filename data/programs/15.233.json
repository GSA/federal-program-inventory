{"id":"15.233","name":"Forest and Woodlands Resource Management","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Forest and Woodland Resource Management Program manages and conserves 58 million acres of forest and woodland in 12 western States and Alaska. These forests provide a range of ecosystem services including wildlife habitat, hydrologic function, and sustainable harvest of forest products valued by society. A primary activity of the program is to maintain and improve the resilience of forest and woodland ecosystems to wildfire, insects, disease, and drought through density management using timber sales and Stewardship agreements. The goals of the program are to: implement science-based forest restoration projects to improve forest health and resilience to wildfires, insects, disease, and drought. Sustainable harvest of forests and woodlands to produce a continuous supply of wood products and biomass for renewable energy. Salvage dead and dying timber to reduce fuels, in balance with the need for wildlife habitat, watershed function, and soil stability, while supporting local economies. Provide the public with commercial and personal use opportunities to harvest products such as firewood, Christmas trees, boughs, greenery, medicinal plants, fence posts, and pinyon pine nuts from forests and woodlands. Removal of beetle-killed timber to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and minimize risks to the recreating public.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/2ab8d6c8da7e4a628e88ca8d2c9e5f5e/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=46abe99e30be8806a24422e7558ac018","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.233","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":21697572.0,"usa_spending_actual":23947160.51},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2832694.0,"usa_spending_actual":-12154051.95},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":19999999.0,"usa_spending_actual":71897.3}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":6175183.01,"obligation":2764469.85},{"x":"2024","outlay":34345.25,"obligation":1504403.6},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":47000.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"No current data available.
