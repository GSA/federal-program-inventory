{"id":"15.424","name":"Marine Minerals Activities","popular_name":"Marine Minerals Activities","objective":"BOEM provides financial assistance to qualified partners to identify and evaluate OCS sediment for potential use in coastal restoration and beach nourishment projects or programs and to foster capacity building and working relationships with coastal States to address coastal erosion, coastal resilience, and climate adaption.  BOEM funds activities such as conducting state-based needs assessments; geophysical and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS; analysis and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological data to delineate sediment resources or benthic habitat; development of regional stratigraphic interpretations or models; modeling to describe or understand  geologic processes that affect sediment resources; feasibility and related technological or operations studies; and cultural resources or shallow hazards identification.  \n\nBOEM also provides financial assistance to qualified partners to assist in the  identification and assessment of other potential OCS mineral resources such as critical minerals (as defined by Executive Order 13817 \u2013 \u201cA Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals\u201d).  BOEM funds activities such as geophysical and geological data acquisition in specific areas on the OCS, as well as analysis and interpretation of existing or new geophysical and geological data to delineate marine minerals.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/115eb7cc90914549b6fac59e63436f03/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=33f54313d031832b8ff3b8e096fa2618","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.424","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","State"],"applicant_types":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3747683.0,"usa_spending_actual":3609309.45},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3432785.0,"usa_spending_actual":3397997.13},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-23.37}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":1647918.73,"obligation":3899764.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":65299.7,"obligation":925000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2018","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2019","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2020","description":"Fiscal Year 2018 \u2013 Awarded funds to three cooperative agreements with; Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, the University of Texas Institute of Geophysics and the University of Southern Mississippi.\nFiscal Year 2018:  Cooperative agreements were awarded to the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy to develop a feasibility study that will examine alternative methodologies for the recovery of economically valuable minerals from marine sand deposits.
