{"id":"10.098","name":"Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for Geographically Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers","popular_name":"RTCP","objective":"The intended goal of the program is to provide direct reimbursement payments to a geographically disadvantaged farmer or rancher who transports an agricultural commodity, or inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity during a fiscal year.  Input transportation cost are transportation costs of inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity including, but not limited to, air, ocean, and land freight of chemicals, feed, fertilizer, fuel, seeds, plants, supplies, equipment parts, and other inputs.\n\nThe Farm Service Agency (FSA), Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP) administers RTCP.  The program will be carried out in the field by FSA State and county committee and FSA employees.  State and local governments and their political subdivisions and related agencies are not eligible for RTCP payments.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/c5c07f62604b451fa316e760ce0c41ba/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=7757ff5d45a13c25c7af82194e0235e9","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.098","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Intrastate"],"beneficiary_types":["Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer"],"applicant_types":["Individual/Family","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":18412.0,"usa_spending_actual":2939290.91},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3889508.0,"usa_spending_actual":3867328.26},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":3036037.37}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":2935641.27,"obligation":2939290.91},{"x":"2024","outlay":3807037.49,"obligation":3867328.26},{"x":"2025","outlay":2821592.8,"obligation":3036037.37}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"RTCP benefits are calculated based on the transportation costs incurred  by producers during the fiscal year.  Due to an increase in funding, RTCP was able to raise the payment cap from $8,000 to $11,200 per producer.  This enhancement allowed for greater financial support for producers, helping them to better offset their transportation costs and easing the financial burden associated with transporting agricultural commodities or inputs over long distances.  However, if the total claims do not exceed the available funding, a higher payment cap may be considered.\n\nEnrollment for RTCP for FY 2024 commenced on July 8, 2024, and concluded on September 30, 2024.  A significant achievement for RTCP this fiscal year was the development and implementation of a new software that automated the application process.  This innovation replaced the previous lengthy manual process, streamlining operations and reducing the time and effort required from both applicants and administrators.\n\nAdditionally, RTCP successfully expedited the timeline for processing payments to producers.  As a results, payments are now being processed months earlier than in previous years.  This improvement ensures that geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers receive their reimbursements more promptly, contributing to better cash flow management for their operations.\n\nThese accomplishments reflect the program\u2019s commitment to supporting geographically disadvantage farmers and ranchers, enhancing operational efficiency, and providing more substantial financial assistance."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"7 U.S.C. &sect; 8792.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/7/8792"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":0,"rules_regulations":"7 CFR Part 755.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
