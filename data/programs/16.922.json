{"id":"16.922","name":"Equitable Sharing Program","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program is a nationwide law enforcement initiative that removes the tools of crime from criminal organizations, deters crime and deprives wrongdoers of their criminal proceeds, and recovers property that may be used to compensate victims.  Equitable sharing further enhances the law enforcement mission by fostering cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.  Federal law authorizes the Attorney General to share federally forfeited property with participating state and local law enforcement agencies.  The exercise of this authority is discretionary and limited by statute.  The Attorney General is not required to share property in any case.
