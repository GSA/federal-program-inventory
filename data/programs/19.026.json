{"id":"19.026","name":"Global Peace Operations Initiative ","popular_name":"GPOI","objective":"The GPOI program enhances international capacity to effectively conduct UN and regional peace operations.  International peace operations are strategically important to U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives.  They represent a cost-effective tool for managing conflict, supporting stabilization in some of the world\u2019s most volatile regions, and facilitating peacebuilding efforts, enabling the international community to share the burden of maintaining peace and security.  The GPOI program is the primary mechanism through which the United States contributes to strengthening global capacity to conduct peace operations.  The program\u2019s partnerships emphasize institutional capacity-building relationships and seek to strengthen partner countries\u2019 capabilities to self-sufficiently train, deploy, employ, and sustain peacekeeping forces.  GPOI activities train and mentor partners to develop critical enabling and rapid deployment capabilities that are greatly needed and consistently requested to fill critical gaps in peace operations; increase the operational capacity of the UN and regional organizations to field more effective peace operations; and seek to develop and reinforce peacekeepers\u2019 capabilities and commitment to protect civilians and promote the role of women in peace operations.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/1edbb050cd77452aaae2dd1befdd057b/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=6440a13d2d8524a8c73fa44e394f5031","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=19.026","top_agency_name":"Department of State","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Builder/Contractor/Developer","Education Professional","Federal","Interstate","Intrastate","Other private institution/organization","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Quasi-public nonprofit organization","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","State","Student/Trainee"],"applicant_types":["Federal","Government - General","Non-Government - General","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Sponsored organization","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":1659508.8},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":7085384.51},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":1117256.83},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":495985.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"632, Foreign Assistance Act, 1961.
