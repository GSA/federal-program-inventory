{"id":"TC.162","name":"Deductibility of casualty losses","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, neither the purchase of property nor insurance premiums to protect the property\u2019s value are deductible as costs of earning income. Therefore, reimbursement for insured loss of such property is not included as a part of gross income, and uninsured losses are not deductible. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a deduction for uninsured casualty and theft losses of more than $100 each, to the extent that total losses during the year exceed 10 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income. In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, personal casualty losses are deductible only to the extent they are attributable to a Federally declared disaster area.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Income Security"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
