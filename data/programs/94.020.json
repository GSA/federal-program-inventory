{"id":"94.020","name":"AmeriCorps CNCS Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement 94.020","popular_name":"AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team","objective":"The AmeriCorps Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement (DRCA) is an initiative through which national service programs provide support to communities affected by disaster and are reimbursed for expenses in times of disasters. Programs that hold a DRCA are part of the AmeriCorps Disaster Response Team (A-DRT) Program, a national service disaster focused program. Only programs with an executed Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement will be eligible for deployment and reimbursement of expenses. Through the A-DRT Program, AmeriCorps establishes cooperative agreements with eligible organizations that can provide national service participants to support disaster response. Organizations that want to be part of the A-DRT Program must be AmeriCorps grantees and sub-grantees, to include AmeriCorps State, AmeriCorps Seniors, State Service Commissions, and AmeriCorps National Direct. Only programs with an executed Disaster Response Cooperative Agreement will be eligible for deployment and reimbursement of expenses.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/a82b1d46a6a641af87ef3ddde0a3eb6f/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=d5a1848d6254e9ee82ac9927787a354f","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=94.020","top_agency_name":"Corporation for National and Community Service","sub_agency_name":"Corporation for National and Community Service","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","School","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"Nearly 1,000 members from twelve A-DRT programs deployed to support volunteer/donations management and direct support to survivors in five federally declared disasters."},{"year":"2017","description":"Not available at this time"}],"authorizations":[{"text":"National and Community Service Act of 1990, as amended..
