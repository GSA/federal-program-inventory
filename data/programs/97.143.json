With there only being one quarter since awards were made, these subapplicants are working on their State-Local Agreements before implementation of the grant project. PDM aims to implement projects that reduce risks posed by natural hazards and reduce future losses, by funding priority projects and activities. Priorities include risk reduction of both acute events and chronic stressors, which are either observed or expected. To achieve these goals, for FY23 PDM, the 89 subapplications that were awarded prioritize the following types of \nactivities: infrastructure projects, those that mitigate risk to lifelines, and projects proposed by applicants that reduce reliance on federal disaster funding. FEMA will measure the percent of dollars invested in these priorities, which will indicate that PDM projects expect to meet the goal of reducing both risks posed by natural hazards and future losses."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Robert T.
