The GNA authority specifically allows BLM to enhance state-federal relationships and addressing cross-boundary land restoration needs to include treating insect-and disease-infested trees; reducing hazardous fuels; any other activities to restore or improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health, including fish and wildlife habitat.  This type of work has reduced wildfire risk to habitat, communities, and state trust lands; creates greater forest and watershed resilience against drought, insects, disease, and wildfire and expands much-needed work across state and federal lands.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/84b48e3d105148678348cd6feefc91ef/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=f658d321ad87b7dc440c31a8cbe84b42","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.015","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":23363795.0,"usa_spending_actual":22463795.31},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":56975719.0,"usa_spending_actual":58501674.15},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":40000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":19381154.26}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":11269519.21,"obligation":22073056.19},{"x":"2024","outlay":8102055.17,"obligation":49299692.31},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":2112266.32}],"results":[{"year":"2020","description":"The Bureau of Land Management has used Good Neighbor to accomplish a number of treatments to forest, rangeland, and stream restoration.
