{"id":"TC.014","name":"Enhanced oil recovery credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"A credit is provided equal to 15 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s costs for enhanced oil recovery on U.S. projects. If the reference price of oil for the previous calendar year is above $28 (adjusted for inflation from 1990), the credit is reduced in proportion to the ratio of the excess over the $28 threshold to $6. Beyond a $6 difference, the credit is fully phased out.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":200000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":140000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
