{"id":"93.600","name":"Head Start","popular_name":"Head Start","objective":"Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the cognitive, physical, behavioral, and social-emotional development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social, and other services to their enrollees - low-income children and families, including those on federally recognized tribal reservations and migratory farm workers.  The program is designed to involve parents in their child\u2019s learning and development, and to help parents make progress toward their educational, literacy, and employment goals.  Head Start also emphasizes the significant involvement of parents in the administration of their local Head Start programs.  The Head Start Program Performance Standards outline the requirements and expectations of programs in delivering these services.  Head Start programs are expected to collaborate with other early care and education programs in their communities, and to work closely with local school systems to continue the gains children achieve in Head Start.\n\nThrough Early Head Start programming, the focus includes the development of children, and the enabling of parents to fulfill their roles while moving toward self-sufficiency. These programs promote the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development of infants and toddlers through safe and developmentally enriching caregiving, preparing children for continued growth and development and eventual success in school and life. To achieve their goals, programs are supported by a three-tier training and technical assistance system (national, regional, and local) designed to complement one another. Objectives of the training and technical assistance system includes expanding staff qualifications and improving management systems and learning environments.\n\nSince 2014 through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, access is expanded to meet the needs for infant and toddler care in communities through traditional Early Head Start programs or through partnerships with center-based and family child care providers who agree to meet the Head Start Program Performance Standards.  \n\nThe Office of Head Start Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) System improves the knowledge, skills, and practices of recipient staff to implement programs which, in turn, improve the outcomes of children and families. The system includes four National Centers, each with an area of focus that collaborate effectively to support and promote consistent practices across Head Start/Early Head Start communities.  The centers include Program Management and Fiscal Operations; Early Childhood Development, Teaching and Learning; Parent, Family, and Community Engagement; and Health, Behavioral Health, and Safety.  \n\nAwards are also issued to Tribal Colleges & Universities for establishing or enhancing partnerships with Head Start programs to effectively increase the number of qualified education staff working in American Indian Alaska Native Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  In collaboration with the Office of Child Care and Office of Early Childhood Development, Head Start provides funding to the National Early Care and Education Workforce Center to support recruitment and retainment strategies across all Early Care and Education settings.  In FY 2023, an award was made available on the National Head Start Fellowship Program to support in the development and implementation of long-term quality improvement initiatives in Head Start programs.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/604525e8ebb94cc29f71d028d67caf94/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=d1f23bc663db398a48d404db9cfebd2e","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.600","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Administration for Children and Families","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["American Indian","Asian","Black","Disabled (e.g. Deaf, Blind, Physically Disabled)","Education (0-8)","Individual/Family","Infant (0-5)","Low Income","Migrant","Minority group","Other Non-White","Preschool","Refugee/Alien","Spanish Origin","U.S. Citizen","Welfare Recipient","Women"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":11711959734.0,"usa_spending_actual":10845819395.45},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":12144413680.0,"usa_spending_actual":11971427818.88},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":12354049599.0,"usa_spending_actual":6517781741.11}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":1866324543.25,"obligation":2563299111.73},{"x":"2024","outlay":3854544569.2,"obligation":6630469594.58},{"x":"2025","outlay":341915765.2,"obligation":1622674665.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"We estimate that the Head Start program will fund 912,156 early childhood slots in FY 2016 that will provide comprehensive services to children and families, the same level as served in FY 2015.
