{"id":"20.826","name":"Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance","popular_name":"META","objective":"The Maritime Environmental and Technical Assistance Program (META) supports the research, demonstration, and development of emerging technologies, practices, and processes to support a safe, efficient, and competitive U.S. Maritime Transportation System. META partners closely with other government agencies, industry, academia, and NGOs to carry out its mission. Results of META-funded projects help to \"de-risk\" new technology applications and provides necessary data for industry to understand \"what works.\" In addition, data from META projects support US policy decisions.\nSince its inception, projects funded through META have primarily focused on major environmental issues such as vessel and port emissions reduction and the control of aquatic invasive species transported by vessels. Over the years, those topics have broadened to include energy efficiency, emissions, alternative fuel and technology applications, hull fouling, and most recent, vessel-generated underwater noise. These topics present significant continuing challenges for ship owners and operators, the regulatory community, and the public. As other maritime environmental issues emerge, additional areas of study may be included.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/84e6aff2e0174448a34d6c03ac53d1c6/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=dd1e78b21be50862ca715292fa5a8ca9","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=20.826","top_agency_name":"Department of Transportation","sub_agency_name":"Maritime Administration (MARAD)","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Education Professional","Federal","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization"],"applicant_types":["Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2025","description":"Results of META projects inform industry applications of new technologies and best practices through studies, demonstrations, technology verification and other processes.
