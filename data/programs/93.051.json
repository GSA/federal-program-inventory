{"id":"93.051","name":"Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States","popular_name":"Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program","objective":"To expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia.\r\n\r\nADSSPS grantees continue to implement two types of ADSSP projects, dementia capability and translation projects. Dementia capability grants require states to help ensure that people with dementia and their family caregivers have access to a home and community-based services system.  Such a system identifies those with dementia, ensures that program staff have appropriate dementia care training, and assures delivery of quality home and community-based services. Evidence-based grants require states to demonstrate how existing evidence-based interventions designed to help people with ADRD and their family caregivers can be translated into effective supportive service programs at the community level.\r\n","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/56014f4309dc4578b75bcd0cde33651c/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=e9a73233fd4625fabe3404e9209bb54c","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.051","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Administration for Community Living (ACL)","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Health Professional","Individual/Family","Physically Afflicted (e.g. TB, Arthritis, Heart Disease)"],"applicant_types":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"Sec 398 of the Public Health Service Act (P.L. 78-410; 42 U.S.C. 280c-3.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Home Health Care and Alzheimer's Disease Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101-557); Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-392).","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
