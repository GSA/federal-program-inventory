{"id":"TC.123","name":"Credit for child and dependent care expenses","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides a tax credit to parents who work or attend school and who have child and dependent care expenses. In taxable year 2023, expenditures up to a maximum $3,000 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more dependents are eligible for a nonrefundable credit. The credit is equal to 35 percent of qualified expenditures for taxpayers with incomes of up to $15,000. The credit is reduced to a minimum of 20 percent by one percentage point for each $2,000 of income in excess of $15,000.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":50000000.0,"forgone_revenue":3480000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":3560000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":3660000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[{"name":"Internal Revenue Service - Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit","outlays":0.0,"improper_payments":0.0,"insufficient_payment":0.0,"high_priority":false,"related_programs":[]}],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
