{"id":"10.334","name":"Enhancing Agricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans Competitive Grants Program","popular_name":"AgVets","objective":"The Enhancing Agricultural Opportunities for Military Veterans Program provides grants to non-profits to increase the number of military veterans gaining knowledge and skills through comprehensive, hands-on and immersive model farm and ranch programs offered regionally that lead to successful careers in the food and agricultural sector. The program encourages the development of training opportunities specifically designed for military veterans. AgVets projects will offer onsite, hands-on training and classroom education leading to a comprehensive understanding of successful farm and ranch operations and management practices. Projects may also offer workforce readiness and employment prospects for service-disabled veterans. Ensuring there are pathways for military veterans interested in pursuing careers in agriculture \u2014 regardless of age or production choice \u2014 strengthens agricultural production and rural economies across the United States. NIFA requests applications for the AgVets to provide grants to nonprofit organizations for training programs and services to establish and enhance farming and ranching opportunities for military veterans.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/f64bb340138846d39353a03c4561066d/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=725e32129f4188a535ba610155e19638","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.334","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"National Institute of Food and Agriculture","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)","Veteran/Service person/Reservist (including dependents"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4791170.0,"usa_spending_actual":4999245.9},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2864576.0,"usa_spending_actual":4169421.18},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2864576.0,"usa_spending_actual":-300955.88}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":2474808.65,"obligation":5068924.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":1602309.49,"obligation":4880979.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"Not applicable."},{"year":"2017","description":"Represents a newly authorized and funded program.\r\nSection 760 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 244) hereby appropriated $5,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2018. \r\nApproximately $4.8 million will be available to fund this program.
