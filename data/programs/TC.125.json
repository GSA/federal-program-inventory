{"id":"TC.125","name":"Deductibility of charitable contributions, other than education and health","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures including charitable contributions. In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers a deduction for contributions to charitable, religious, and certain other nonprofit organizations. Taxpayers who donate capital assets to charitable organizations can deduct the assets\u2019 current value without being taxed on any appreciation in value. An individual\u2019s total charitable contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent (60 percent between 2018 and 2025) of adjusted gross income; a corporation\u2019s total charitable contributions generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":47410000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":46240000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":47460000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
