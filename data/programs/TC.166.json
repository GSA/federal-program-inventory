{"id":"TC.166","name":"Exclusion of social security benefits: Credit for certain employer contributions to social security","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, employer contributions to Social Security represent labor cost and are deductible expenses. Under current law, however, certain employers are allowed a tax credit, instead of a deduction, against taxes paid on tips received from customers in connection with the providing, delivering, or serving of food or beverages for consumption. The tip credit equals the full amount of the employer\u2019s share of FICA taxes paid on the portion of tips, when added to the employee\u2019s non-tip wages, in excess of $5.15 per hour. The credit is available only with respect to FICA taxes paid on tips.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Social Security"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1520000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1740000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1830000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
