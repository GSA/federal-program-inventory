{"id":"97.130","name":"National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program","popular_name":"National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program Nuclear Forensics Research Award ((NNFEDP NFRA)","objective":"The objectives of this program are: (1) to provide a stable foundation from which to develop and maintain the nuclear forensics workforce; (2) to provide an academic pathway from undergraduate to post-doctorate study in disciplines directly relevant to nuclear forensics, including but not limited to radiochemistry, geochemistry, nuclear physics, nuclear engineering, materials science, and analytical chemistry; and (3) to increase a diverse and highly talented cadre of new and emerging forensics experts who will fill specific expertise gaps in the area of nuclear forensics, an important homeland security mission. These objectives are aligned with the Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act, P.L.111-140, reaffirmed in Sections 1923(a)(12) and 1926 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 592(a)(12), 596). The following goals have been established to meet these objectives: \u2022 Recruit and produce a new generation of leaders and technical experts in a wide range of fields relevant to nuclear forensics. \u2022 Enhance the ability for universities and the national and defense laboratories to work collaboratively on advanced research in the nuclear forensics field. \u2022 Implement nuclear forensics research awards to encourage undergraduate and graduate students to perform forensic-related research in collaboration with academic professors and researchers at the national laboratories. These awards promote research that advances nuclear forensics methods, such as detection, characterization of materials, and analysis of signatures, while encouraging universities to invest in these types of programs, and feed students into post-doctoral/permanent staff positions in nuclear forensics at the national laboratories or federal agencies.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/b71f734554b64001885ac7a0d513fe20/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=5b7d02c21cfdfd9fd35065f233e3a627","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.130","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":"Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Education (13+)","Federal"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4095000.0,"usa_spending_actual":2790000.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1800000.0,"usa_spending_actual":1168925.33},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":2790000.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":73163.3,"obligation":1196122.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"\u2022 Facilitate collaboration and integration among academic programs, universities, and national laboratories.\r\n\u2022 Manage day-to-day administration of the Nuclear Forensics Undergraduate Scholarship Program, Nuclear Forensics Graduate Fellowship Program, Nuclear Forensics Junior Faculty Award Program, Nuclear Forensics Education Award Program, and Nuclear Forensics Minority Serving Institution Collaboration Award Program.
