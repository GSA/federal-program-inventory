{"id":"96.008","name":"Social Security - Work Incentives Planning and Assistance Program ","popular_name":"SSA Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) Program or Work Incentives Outreach Program","objective":"To comply with the Ticket-to-Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act (TWWIIA) which was passed in December 1999, and reauthorized by the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, which requires the SSA to establish a community-based work incentives planning and assistance program. The purpose of the program is to support beneficiaries who want to return to work to make a successful and profitable transition to the workforce.  Beneficiaries that continue to work improve their economic independence and financial security.  WIPA projects help beneficiaries take advantage of our work incentives programs, which may delay or reduce the effect of work on monetary benefits and health insurance.  Additionally, WIPA projects act as repositories for information about other work incentives, benefits counseling services, and other resources that may help beneficiaries succeed in their work attempts, or may assist beneficiaries to improve financial stability as they return to work.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/bb675f7014a547aca0f0ce3d45189326/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=a12860cbb65c5b4eafc3e7fce9efb334","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=96.008","top_agency_name":"Social Security Administration","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Local","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":19880111.51},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":19954650.38},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":195163.73,"obligation":300000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"1, 1149, Social Security Act. 1860 Stat. 1887-1891.
