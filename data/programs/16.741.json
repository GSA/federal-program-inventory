{"id":"16.741","name":"DNA Backlog Reduction Program","popular_name":"CEBR","objective":"Program now funded under Assistance Listing 16.036. \n\nGoal(s): \u202fThe goal is to assist eligible States and units of local government to increase laboratory capacity and reduce the number of samples awaiting analysis in both the casework and database sections.\n\nObjective:  To assist eligible States and units of local government to process, record, screen, and analyze forensic DNA  and/or DNA database samples to increase the capacity of public forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories to process more DNA samples, thereby helping to reduce the number of forensic DNA and DNA database samples awaiting analysis.\n\nThe Formula DNA CEBR Program awards funding to eligible entities with two main program objectives:\n1. Increase the number of CODIS-eligible samples analyzed in forensic DNA and DNA database laboratories.\n2. Reduce the forensic case and DNA database sample turnaround times for CODIS entry.\n\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of DNA profile uploads into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS); and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Number of cases completed since the beginning of the grant period.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/0f6c3381fbc44d01b1fce5478a04838c/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=4c0f2aa6c8c375eca4b29b3f26864339","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.741","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Office of Justice Programs","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Local","State"],"applicant_types":["Interstate","Intrastate","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3141795.0,"usa_spending_actual":116255010.51},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2491297.0,"usa_spending_actual":-2023663.19},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-904209.81}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":54545297.85,"obligation":119687358.25},{"x":"2024","outlay":3915714.45,"obligation":-180418.42},{"x":"2025","outlay":477944.66,"obligation":-57055.34}],"results":[{"year":"2018","description":"This program has funded the analysis of thousands of DNA cases, including sexual assault kits, in state and local crime laboratories and the entry of hundreds of missing and unidentified persons cases into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, NamUs."},{"year":"2019","description":"This program has funded state and local crime laboratories for the analysis of hundreds of thousands of DNA database and casework samples, including those from sexual assault kits, for upload into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)."},{"year":"2020","description":"See the BJA website at www.bja.gov."},{"year":"2021","description":"Please visit https://bja.ojp.gov/program/coverdell/overview for information."},{"year":"2022","description":"See BJA\u2019s DNA CEBR Program Website at https://bja.ojp.gov/program/dna-cebr/grantees"}],"authorizations":[{"text":"An act appropriating funds for the Department of Justice in the current fiscal year and, beginning with fiscal year 2018 and in certain, specified subsequent years, Section 3(a) of P.L. 114-324, the Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 (see program solicitation and award documentation for applicability).","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"See 2 CFR Part 200, 2 CFR Part 2800, the current fiscal year\u2019s solicitation available at https://www.ojp.gov/funding/explore/current-funding-opportunities, and the Department of Justice Grants Financial Guide, available at https://www.ojp.gov/funding/financialguidedoj/overview.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":{"id":"P1","name":"Advance the Capabilities of the Forensic Sciences","gwo":"Advance the Capabilities of the Forensic Sciences","permalink":"/gwo/P1/"},"pons":[{"pon":"Increase Law Enforcement Operational Capacity","permalink":"/pon/N36"}]}
