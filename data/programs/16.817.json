{"id":"16.817","name":"Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program","popular_name":"BCJI","objective":"Goals: \nThe goal of the BCJI is to reduce crime and improve community safety as part of a comprehensive strategy to rebuild neighborhoods and spur revitalization. Through a broad cross-sector partnership team, including neighborhood residents, BCJI grantees target neighborhoods with persistent hot spots of violent and serious crime and employ data-driven, cross-sector strategies to reduce crime and violence and increase trust.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo achieve BCJI  program goals and objectives, the fiscal agent must commit to accomplishing the following:\n\u2022\tIdentify a neighborhood with a concentration of crime hot spots which have for a period of time composed a significant proportion of crime or types of crime;\n\u2022\tEnsure meaningful engagement of residents and other partners, including coordination in the development or implementation of a comprehensive and coordinated strategic plan;\n\u2022\tDevelop and/or implement a plan that outlines a set of strategies that offers a continuum of approaches to address crime drivers including enforcement, prevention, intervention, and revitalization strategies with support from the BCJI training and technical assistance provider;\n\u2022\tDemonstrate commitment and a clear history of the partners, including the local law enforcement agency and a research partner or team, to support the data collection and analysis throughout the life of the grant;\n\u2022\tDemonstrate ability to hire and support a skilled lead site coordinator that will oversee and facilitate coordination and collaboration among criminal justice and service providers (e.g., by the formation of a diverse advisory board or cross-sector partnership team to address an identified problem);\n\u2022\tFacilitate, as appropriate, collaboration with relevant local, state, or federal initiatives  located in, adjacent, or overlapping the jurisdiction that addresses issues that relate to the crime issues identified; and,\n\u2022\tSupport the planning, implementation and sustainment of the program through proactive program management tied to rigorous research and data analysis, program assessment, and leverage other funding and resources.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/f9fc3b798ddc4f10844e869073c01f47/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=d6a569d3c7cbe5294eb980348500fdae","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.817","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Office of Justice Programs","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local","Other private institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":865018.96},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-93753.89},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-874625.66}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":554558.39,"obligation":630149.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"Since 2012, 74 sites have received a combined $54.7 million in grants under the CBCR Program and have yielded the following results:\n\nSignificant reduction in crime\nNew homes and businesses in neighborhoods previously deemed unsafe\nMore collaboration between police and residents to solve problems\nMore effective and efficient deployment of public resources\n\nCBCR has provided resources to convene a diverse collection of local partners including law enforcement, prosecutors, researchers, service providers, residents and community developers to examine contributing factors to crime trends and solutions to reduce those elements to improve public safety in distressed communities."},{"year":"2018","description":"Since 2012, 74 sites have received a combined $54.7 million in grants under the CBCR Program and have yielded the following results:\n-Significant reduction in crime;\n-New homes and businesses in neighborhoods previously deemed unsafe;\n-More collaboration between police and residents to solve problems;

Some accomplishments across the four core objectives include: \n\nCrime and Offending:\n\u2022\tPart I crimes in Philadelphia\u2019s target area dropped from an average of 61 per year to 46 per year between 2012 and 2015. Additionally, one year after revitalization work was completed at one hotspot\u2014the intersection of 34th and Haverford\u2014crime decreased 75 percent (from 168 incidents every 6 months to 40) and there were no shootings.\n\n\u2022\tCrime in the immediate area targeted by the Flint, Michigan, CBCR effort dropped 20 percent from 2015 to 2016.  This includes drug-related loitering and assaults and shootings. In one hotspot, violent crime declined 16 percent and property crime declined 14 percent. In a second hotspot along the same commercial corridor, violent crime declined 14 percent and property crime declined 51 percent.\n\nEconomic Investment and Revitalization:  \n\u2022\tThe Sheriff\u2019s Office of Alameda County, California, is leading revitalization efforts to create more economic opportunities along a vacant commercial corridor that has been a hotspot for criminal activity for at least a decade by launching \u201cEden Night Live.\u201d One of the main goals of Eden Night Live is to help small businesses increase their local consumer base and create opportunities for entrepreneurs, while creating a place where people can feel connected to one another.\n\nSocial Cohesion and Community-Police Collaboration:\n\u2022\tIn Youngstown, Ohio, more than 500 volunteers, organized through 25 project partners, volunteered to board up and clean a significant number of vacant properties in the CBCR target area. Volunteers cleaned up and secured 71 vacant properties and removed 206 tires, 800 cubic yards of illegally dumped debris, and 467 bags of trash. The City of Youngstown also demolished seven abandoned, severely blighted houses as part of the project.\n\nCost effectiveness and Sustainability:\n\u2022\tThe Syracuse, New York, CBCR Program successfully created and implemented a Peacemaking Center, training 36 community members to provide free community-based conflict resolution to individuals referred by justice system stakeholders. The program\u2019s success helped garner three additional funding sources to support and expand the program and staffing, which moved it from a neighborhood-based to a countywide program. \n\nMore highlights of these sites\u2019 work and results may be reviewed here: \nhttp://www.lisc.org/our-initiatives/safe-neighborhoods/cbcr/cbcr-results/"},{"year":"2021","description":"Please visit https://www.lisc.org/our-initiatives/safety-justice/cbcr/where-it-happening/\n\nBJA awarded $18.8 million under its Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program, which will fund a strategic approach to crime reduction in local jurisdictions that leverages community knowledge and expertise to build public trust with law enforcement and make neighborhoods safer."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. 134 Stat. 1182, 1258.
