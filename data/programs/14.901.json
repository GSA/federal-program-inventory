{"id":"14.901","name":"Healthy Homes Weatherization Cooperation Demonstration Grants","popular_name":"Healthy Homes and Weatherization Cooperation Demonstration Grants, Radon Testing and Mitigation Demonstration in Public Housing Grants","objective":"HUD, through this Healthy Homes and Weatherization Cooperation Demonstration (HHWCD) NOFO, is interested in supporting demonstrations in up to 5 communities that provide housing interventions in lower-income households that are conducted jointly through the coordination of HUD\u2019s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH)-funded\n Healthy Homes Production (HHP) program and programs funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).  A critical goal of this demonstration is to determine whether this coordinated delivery of services achieves cost-effectiveness and better outcomes in improving the safety and quality of homes, including health and energy efficiency.  The coordinated assessments and interventions are expected to provide additional benefits to households through the combined mitigation of health and safety hazards and improvements in energy efficiency and comfort.
