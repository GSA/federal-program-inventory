{"id":"TC.141","name":"Credit for family and sick leave taken by self-employed individuals","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted as specific groups. Under current law, however, self-employed individuals are allowed a refundable credit equal for certain family or sick leave taken. In general, the sick leave credit is equal to 100% of daily self-employment income (equal to self-employment income divided by 260) during a period of qualified sick leave, up to $511 per day for 10 days. The family leave credit is equal to two thirds of daily self-employment income (but no greater than two thirds of $200) during a period of qualified family leave for up to 10 weeks.
