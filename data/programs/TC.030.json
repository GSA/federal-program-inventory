{"id":"TC.030","name":"Clean hydrogen production credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows credits for the production of clean hydrogen. Clean hydrogen is defined in relation to its lifecycle greenhouse has emissions rate; no credit is allowed for hydrogen with a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate greater than 4 kilogram of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen. The credit applies to qualified clean hydrogen produced at a qualified clean hydrogen production facility during the 10-year period beginning on the date such facility was originally placed in service. Qualifying facilities must be placed in service before December 31, 2033.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":340000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":310000000.0,"forgone_revenue":540000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":610000000.0,"forgone_revenue":860000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
