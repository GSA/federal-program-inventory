{"id":"TC.104","name":"Tax credits for post-secondary education expenses","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Under current law in 2023, however, there are two credits for certain post-secondary education expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) allows a partially refundable credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student for qualified tuition and related expenses paid. The AOTC may be claimed during each of the first four years of the student\u2019s post-secondary education. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) allows a non-refundable credit for 20 percent of an eligible student\u2019s qualified tuition and fees, up to a maximum credit of $2,000 per return. The LLC may be claimed during any year of the student\u2019s post-secondary education. Only one credit may be claimed per student per year. The combined credits are phased out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $160,000 and $180,000 if married filing jointly ($80,000 and $90,000 for other taxpayers), not indexed. Married individuals filing separate returns cannot claim either credit.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":2490000000.0,"forgone_revenue":13940000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":2460000000.0,"forgone_revenue":11190000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":2420000000.0,"forgone_revenue":11060000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[{"name":"Internal Revenue Service - American Opportunity Tax Credit","outlays":5176490000.0,"improper_payments":1431300000.0,"insufficient_payment":0.0,"high_priority":true,"related_programs":[]}],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
