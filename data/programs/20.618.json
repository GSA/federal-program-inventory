{"id":"20.618","name":"Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety","popular_name":"Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety Program (DADSS)","objective":"The goal of the DADSS collaborative research program is to research and develop alcohol detection technologies that are less intrusive than currently available ignition interlocks. Technologies that are integrated into vehicles may hold the greatest promise for widespread deployment. This program is focused on the research, development and testing of non-invasive breath and touch-based alcohol detection devices and subsequent hardware that shall result in one or more commercially viable devices that can be installed in vehicles.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/df7f72f9b6614453902fe0d53e89091d/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=c942498fa280a9d17143c6a1d620b1ba","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=20.618","top_agency_name":"Department of Transportation","sub_agency_name":"National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federal","State"],"applicant_types":["Federal","State"],"categories":["Transportation - Ground Transportation"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":11250000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":11249999.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":11250000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"This program has developed in-vehicle alcohol detection devices from conceptual plans to Breath-based test devices that are in field operational testing phase with human subjects."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Pub.
