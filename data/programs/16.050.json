{"id":"16.050","name":"Missing and Unidentified Human Remains (MUHR) Program","popular_name":null,"objective":"Administered by the Office of Justice Programs\u2019 (OJP) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Missing and Unidentified Human Remains (MUHR) Program provides funds to enable eligible entities to improve the reporting, transportation, forensic testing, and identification of missing persons and unidentified human remains, including migrants. This program furthers the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s mission of increasing public safety by providing resources to locate and identify missing persons and unidentified human remains in the United States. The MUHR Program augments and complements the services available through the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), National Institute of Justice National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) Program. NamUs is a free, national, centralized repository and resource center for cases involving missing persons, unidentified human remains, and unclaimed persons. The MUHR Program fills a gap in the national field by providing federal resources directly to state and local jurisdictions. As a result, the MUHR Program helps jurisdictions become more self-sufficient in reducing their backlog of missing persons and unidentified human remains cases.\n\nPerformance Measure 1:  The number of missing persons cases (including migrants) processed (all purpose areas); and,\n\nPerformance Measure 2:  The number of unidentified human remains cases (including migrants) processed (all purpose areas).","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/c98fe720d84c4812889ef74abb41973b/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=1215002ba6984e919abba25f1124bec2","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.050","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["City or Township Government","County Government","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":9879479.0,"usa_spending_actual":9824479.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":764232.0,"usa_spending_actual":714232.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":4199721.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":2699657.29,"obligation":9824479.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":714232.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":18120.21,"obligation":4199721.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"Since its inception in 2022, the MUHR Program has made 19 awards totaling $13,124,479.
