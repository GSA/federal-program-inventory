These courses provide foundational instruction on the principles of NIBIN and crime gun intelligence, as well as complex investigations involving criminal organizations. Additionally, WSU has developed several accredited training programs for law enforcement, prosecutors, and other criminal justice professionals, as well as a robust internship program with all partnering agencies, including CGICs, labs, District Attorney\u2019s offices, U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices, corrections, probation/parole, and local police departments. The ability to educate broad audiences on forensics, NIBIN, and crime gun intelligence impacts communities negatively impacted by firearm violence. NIBIN is an unbiased way of identifying the most prolific shooters and the collaborative partnerships among local, state, and federal partners have led to more effective gun crime investigations and improved strategic efforts surrounding resource allocation. Developing standard education and training expands the knowledge base of crime gun intelligence and increases the number of professionals using these advanced investigative methods."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2022. 136 Stat. 49, 125.
