{"id":"TC.077","name":"Step-up basis of capital gains at death","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains would be taxed when assets are transferred at death. It would not allow for exempting gains upon transfer of the underlying assets to the heirs. In contrast, capital gains on assets held at the owner\u2019s death are not subject to capital gains tax under current law. The cost basis of the appreciated assets is adjusted to the market value at the owner\u2019s date of death which becomes the basis for the heirs.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":49240000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":33560000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":37830000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
