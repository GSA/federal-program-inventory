{"id":"TC.091","name":"Exclusion for employer-provided transit passes","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for passes, tokens, fare cards, and vanpool expenses that are paid for by an employer or that are received by the employee in lieu of wages to defray an employee\u2019s commuting costs. Due to a parity to parking provision, the maximum amount of the transit exclusion is $315 per month in 2024. However, beginning in 2018, transit expenses are no longer deductible to employers.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Transportation"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":369000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":390000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":410000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
