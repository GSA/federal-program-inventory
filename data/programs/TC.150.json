{"id":"TC.150","name":"Net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings: Defined contribution employer plans","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including deferred and dedicated payments, should be included in taxable income. In addition, investment income would be taxed as earned. In contrast, under current law individual taxpayers and employers can make tax-preferred contributions to employer-provided 401(k) and similar plans (e.g. 403(b) plans and the Federal Government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan). In 2024, an employee could exclude up to $23,000 of wages from AGI under a qualified arrangement with an employer\u2019s 401(k) plan. Employees age 50 or over could exclude up to $30,500 in contributions. The defined contribution plan limit, including both employee and employer contributions, is $69,000 in 2024. The tax on contributions made by both employees and employers and the investment income earned by these plans is deferred until withdrawn.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Income Security"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":134000000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":145000000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":152000000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
