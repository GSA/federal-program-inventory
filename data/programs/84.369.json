{"id":"84.369","name":"Grants for State Assessments and Related Activities","popular_name":null,"objective":"The purpose of this program is: to pay the costs of developing the standards and high-quality assessments required by Title I of the ESEA. Once a State has put in place those standards and assessments, it may use program funds to pay for the administration of the assessments and for other activities related to ensuring that the State\u2019s schools and LEAs are held accountable for results and helping students attain challenging academic standards linked to college- and career-readiness. Such activities may include, among other things, developing standards and assessments in subjects other than those required by Title I, refining State assessments to ensure continued alignment with standards, expanding the range of testing accommodations for students with disabilities and for English Learner students, developing multiple measures to ensure the validity and reliability of State assessments, and using academic assessment instruments such as performance and technology-based assessments or computer adaptive assessments to better reflect the kind of complex work students do in an effective classroom and the real world.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/23a71e7c051e4486a92b3b1195742614/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=6a17bd3a8a70272428f94434f68b0fc5","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=84.369","top_agency_name":"Department of Education","sub_agency_name":"Office of Elementary and Secondary Education","assistance_types":["Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Education Professional","Local","School","State"],"applicant_types":["State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":369100000.0,"usa_spending_actual":365406932.19},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":369100000.0,"usa_spending_actual":363360159.62},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":369100000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-286468.89}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":263459987.94,"obligation":365409000.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":90056240.76,"obligation":365409000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2017","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2018","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2019","description":"Made grants to 56 State educational agencies."},{"year":"2023","description":"Made grants to 53 State educational agencies."},{"year":"2024","description":"Made grants to 53 State educational agencies."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"I, B, 1201, Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), Parts 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, 86, 97, 98, and 99. 34 CFR Parts 200 and 300.
