{"id":"16.742","name":"Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement Grant Program","popular_name":"Coverdell Program","objective":"Goal(s): The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grants Program (the Coverdell Program) awards grants to states and units of local government to help improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science and medical examiner/coroner services. (Proposed, from BJA website) \n\nObjective(s): The objectives of the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Program are to: 1. Carry out all or a substantial part of a program intended to improve the quality and timeliness of forensic science or medical examiner/coroner\u2019s office services, including those services provided by laboratories operated by the State and those operated by units of local government within the state; 2. Eliminate a backlog in the analysis of forensic science evidence, including, among other things, a backlog with respect to firearms examination, latent prints, impression evidence, toxicology, digital evidence, fire evidence, controlled substances, forensic pathology, questioned documents, and trace evidence; 3. Train, assist, and employ forensic laboratory personnel and medicolegal death investigators, as needed to eliminate such a backlog; 4. Address emerging forensic science issues (such as statistics, contextual bias, and uncertainty of measurement) and emerging forensic science technology (such as high throughput automation, statistical software, and new types of instrumentation); 5. Educate and train forensic pathologists; and 6. Fund medicolegal death investigation systems to facilitate accreditation of medical examiner and coroner offices and certification of medicolegal death investigators.\nPerformance Measure 1: Number of backlogged cases analyzed with Coverdell funds; and,  \n\nPerformance Measure 2:  Number of forensics and medical examiner personnel trained.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/0b2e904397ee4c3faa32a6eca9473e97/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=4c067a59b9627f68deb8c0e150c21a65","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.742","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Office of Justice Programs","assistance_types":["Government - General","Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Local","State"],"applicant_types":["Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":35000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":30712958.52},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":34000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":28087585.17},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":35000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-464021.06}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":13611846.77,"obligation":31270782.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":119839.04,"obligation":29469578.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"The Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement (Coverdell) Program has substantially contributed to the increase of quality and timeliness of forensic science in state and local forensic laboratories and medical examiner/coroner\u2019s offices.
