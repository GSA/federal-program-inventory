{"id":"97.106","name":"Securing the Cities Program","popular_name":"(STC) ","objective":"The DHS Secretary established the STC Program, managed through the Assistant Secretary for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, to enhance the ability of the United States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high-consequence events utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials that pose risk to homeland security in high-risk urban areas.  Support to recipients includes assistance in developing and integrating local or regional programs into a national detection structure, guiding the development of Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) and standard operating procedures, providing radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection equipment, and providing training and exercise products to ensure detection is integrated into day-to-day activities and that partners are proficient in the detection mission area.  \nThe STC Goal and Objectives are: \nGoal - Develop/enhance sustainable radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection capabilities among regional operational partners\nObjectives - a) Assist state, local, tribal and territorial governments in developing R/N detection and reporting capability; b) Establish information connectivity to support radiological/nuclear alarm adjudication; c) Establish administrative infrastructure to support a R/N detection program; d) Establish coordination mechanisms between operational partners for steady state operations, enhanced steady state operations and search operations.\n\n* DHS CWMD worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy to create the Domestic Detection CONOPS to facilitate an effective \"whole of government\" response among mission partners to detect and communicate about potential or actual threats involving R/N materials within the United States.  DHS will provide the Domestic Detection CONOPS to grant recipients as a basis for planning their regional CONOPS.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/b167df80696840d4a802f24590091539/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=73f68d08a10b198d7d42f801f29b532b","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.106","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":"Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Interstate","Intrastate","Local","State"],"applicant_types":["Interstate","Intrastate","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":16575000.0,"usa_spending_actual":14692077.13},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":28481679.14,"usa_spending_actual":28481679.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":20000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":3204577.13},{"x":"2024","outlay":2394766.33,"obligation":3125000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"\u2022 Continue Phase III (non-STC funded) activities in NYC/Newark.\r\n\u2022 Begin Phase II activities in Los Angeles/Long Beach STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022 Continue Phase I activities in the National Capital Region STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022 Continue Phase I activities in the Houston STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022 Initiate Phase I activities in the Chicago STC implementation site.\r\n \u2022\tContinued Phase III (non-STC funded) activities in New York City (NYC)/Newark.\r\n\u2022\tBegan Phase II activities in Los Angeles/Long Beach STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022\tContinued Phase I activities in the National Capital Region STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022\tInitiated Phase I activities in the Houston STC implementation site.\r\n\u2022\tAwarded initial funding to the Chicago STC implementation site.\r\n\r\n"},{"year":"2017","description":"\u2022 STC did not issue FY17 funding during FY17, instead a 1-year no cost extension was issued to NCR, Houston and Chicago. \u2022 Continued Phase III (non-STC funded) activities in NYC/Newark. \u2022 Completed Phase II activities in Los Angeles/Long Beach STC implementation site. \u2022 Completed Phase I activities in the National Capital Region STC implementation site. \u2022 Continued Phase I activities in the Houston STC implementation site. \u2022 Initiated Phase I activities in the Chicago STC Implementation site."},{"year":"2018","description":"\u2022 Issued awards to Houston and Chicago \u2022 Issued awards to STC Regions * Continue Phase III (non-STC funded) activities in NYC/Newark. \u2022 Continue Phase III (non-STC funded) activities in Los Angeles/Long beach STC implementation site. \u2022  Begin Phase III activities in the National Capital Region STC implementation site. \u2022 Complete Phase I activities in the Houston STC implementation site. \u2022 Continue Phase I activities in the Chicago STC implementation site."},{"year":"2019","description":"\u2022 The STC program came out of an operational pause to restructure the program.
