BLM\u2019s continued commitment to reduce and streamline its processes and procedures to serve its customers and the public better and faster across all its program areas. These reforms allow the Bureau to realign time and resources to completing important on\u2013the-ground work to utilize qualified youth or conservation corps to carry out appropriate conservation projects on public lands, cooperatively with the BLM on cultural and natural resource related conservation projects such as trail development and maintenance, historic, cultural, forest and timber management, minor construction work, archaeological conservation, and native plant habitat restoration and rehabilitation. Promote and stimulate public purposes such as education, job training, development of responsible citizenship, productive community involvement, and further the understanding and appreciation of natural and cultural resources through the involvement of youth and young adults in the care and enhancement of public resources. Continue the longstanding efforts of the BLM to provide opportunities for public service, youth employment, minority youth development and training, and participation of young adults in accomplishing conservation-related work.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/a64e463809fb40939209ec45aa367c71/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=c3cd9d8f8bece4fcff87a2aa8a26d817","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.243","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":10955884.0,"usa_spending_actual":9935229.53},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":23186334.0,"usa_spending_actual":22648142.34},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":14999999.0,"usa_spending_actual":6768777.42}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":6436568.69,"obligation":11436849.19},{"x":"2024","outlay":3543983.38,"obligation":16971240.86},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":5776346.56}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"BLM anticipates issuing cooperative agreements to provide similar conservation work and training opportunities for at least 2,500 youth.
