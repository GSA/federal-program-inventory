The ECIP is not a grant program. The ECIP is a direct investment program comprising the purchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt instruments from eligible financial institutions.  No new awards are being made but existing projects are still active.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/98985a5e0b6e45eda88e09f211214eef/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=90d27866b9bfcbeb35f66d2a16480487","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=21.030","top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Departmental Offices","assistance_types":["Intrastate"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Other private institutions/organizations","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Profit organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":284692000.0,"usa_spending_actual":284692000.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":284692000.0,"obligation":284692000.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2024","description":"Data from the first 18 months of the implementation of the program demonstrate that community financial institutions participating in ECIP were well-positioned to deliver loans and other resources, at scale, to financially underserved communities that were particularly impacted by the pandemic. In approximately 18 months, ECIP participants originated a total of $58.3 billion in loans, of which more than one third was to the most underserved borrowers. Approximately three quarters, or $43.0 billion, of these originations was qualified lending to targeted communities. More than one third of these total originations, or $20.6 billion, was deep impact lending to the most underserved borrowers.
