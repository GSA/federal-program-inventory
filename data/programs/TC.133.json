{"id":"TC.133","name":"Deductibility of medical expenses","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, under current law personal expenditures for medical care (including the costs of prescription drugs) exceeding 7.5 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income are deductible. For tax years beginning after 2012, only medical expenditures exceeding 10 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income are deductible. However, for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, if either the taxpayer or the taxpayer\u2019s spouse turned 65 before the end of the taxable year, the threshold remained at 7.5 percent of adjusted income. Beginning in 2017, the 10 percent threshold applied to all taxpayers, including those over 65.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Health"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":12260000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":12640000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":13420000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
