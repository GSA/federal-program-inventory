{"id":"TC.152","name":"Net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings: Low and moderate income savers credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities or targeted at specific groups. In contrast, the Tax Code provides an additional incentive for lower-income taxpayers to save through a nonrefundable credit of up to 50 percent on IRA and other retirement contributions of up to $2,000. This credit is in addition to any deduction or exclusion. The credit is completely phased out by $76,500 for joint filers, $57,375 for head of household filers, and $38,250 for other filers in 2024. Starting in Tax Year 2027, the Saver\u2019s Credit, which is nonrefundable, is replaced with the Saver\u2019s Match, which is refundable.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Income Security"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1860000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1870000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1910000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
