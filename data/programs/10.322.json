{"id":"10.322","name":"Distance Education Grants for Institutions of Higher Education in Insular Areas","popular_name":"DEG","objective":"The purpose of the DEG program is to strengthen the capacity of institutions of higher education in insular areas to carry out resident instruction, curriculum, and teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences through distance education technology. Projects funded by the DEG program support the creation, adaptation, and adoption of learning materials and teaching strategies to operationalize what we know about how students learn. Many of these concepts are identified in the National Research Council\u2019s publication, \u201cHow People Learn.\u201d DEG-funded projects shall also focus on imparting both technical knowledge as well employability skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem solving. These concepts can be found in the publication: https://www.aplu.org/projects-and-initiatives/agriculture-human-sciences-and-natural-resources/employability-skills-in-agriculture/index.html.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/7ba82be6c2324c518b6b6d036b1e019d/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=34b2d5121e29a349574e0103a8db885a","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.322","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"National Institute of Food and Agriculture","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Other public institution/organization","State"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":800000.0,"usa_spending_actual":284235.78},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1896388.0,"usa_spending_actual":-118841.51},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1896388.0,"usa_spending_actual":-16275.61}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":97216.29,"obligation":390595.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"For FY 2016 $800,000 was available for DEG awards.  \r\n\r\nTwelve applications were reviewed by a panel and eight (8) proposals were recommended for awards.  \r\n\r\nThe final eight (8) proposals range from the lowest of $115,000 to the highest of $150,000.  \r\n\r\nThe ratio is 67%.  \r\n\r\n For Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 $768,000 was available for Distance Education Grants Program (DEG) awards.  \r\n\r\nTwelve applications were reviewed by a panel and eight (8) proposals were recommended for awards.  \r\n\r\nThe final eight (8) proposals range from the lowest of $115,000 to the highest of $150,000.  \r\n\r\nThe award ratio is 67 percent (67%). \r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE: See CFDA # 10.308 for other pertinent financial information.\r\n"},{"year":"2017","description":"For fiscal Year (FY) 2017, the consolidated appropriation for Insular Area Grants (CFDA # 10.308 and # 10.322) was approximately $2 million.
