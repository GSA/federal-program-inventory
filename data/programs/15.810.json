{"id":"15.810","name":"National Cooperative Geologic Mapping ","popular_name":"(StateMap and EdMap)","objective":"To produce geologic maps of areas in which knowledge of geology is important to the economic, social, or scientific welfare of individual States. StateMap supports: (1) projects which produce new geologic maps with attendant explanatory information including correlation of map units, description of map units and symbols, stratigraphic columns, geologic sections, and other pertinent information; and (2) projects which compile existing geologic data in a digital form for inclusion in the National Digital Geologic Map Database. EdMap: Provide funding for undergraduate and graduate students in academic research programs, through cooperative agreements, that involve geologic mapping and scientific data analysis as major components; expand research and educational capacity of graduate programs that teach earth science students the techniques of geologic mapping and field data analysis; and facilitate the publication and distribution of geologic maps generated in field-based graduate academic research programs.
