{"id":"TC.011","name":"Excess of percentage over cost depletion, oil and gas","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would allow recovery of the costs of developing certain oil and gas properties using cost depletion. Cost depletion is similar in concept to depreciation, in that the costs of developing or acquiring the asset are capitalized and then gradually reduced over an estimate of the asset\u2019s economic life, as is appropriate for measuring net income. In contrast, the Tax Code generally allows independent oil and gas producers and royalty owners to take percentage depletion deductions rather than cost depletion on limited quantities of output. Under percentage depletion, taxpayers deduct a percentage of gross income from oil and gas production. In certain cases the deduction is limited to a fraction of the asset\u2019s net income. Over the life of an investment, percentage depletion deductions can exceed the cost of the investment. Consequently, percentage depletion may provide more advantageous tax treatment than would cost depletion, which limits deductions to an investment\u2019s cost.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1530000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1400000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1480000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
