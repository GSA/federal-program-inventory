{"id":"64.101","name":"Burial Expenses Allowance for Veterans","popular_name":null,"objective":"If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2024, VA will provide a monetary allowance not to exceed $978, or that amount authorized under 38 U.S.C. 2303, whichever is greater, toward the plot or interment expense for certain Veterans not buried in a national cemetery with a non-service-connected death. Up to $978 as a burial allowance is payable toward the burial expense of certain Veterans. If death is the result of a service-connected disability, payments can be made to reimburse burial and funeral expenses not to exceed $2,000 or that amount authorized under 5 U.S.C. 8134(a), whichever is greater. In addition to the statutory burial allowance, the cost of transporting the Veterans' remains from place of death to site of burial is paid by VA if death occurs in a VA facility. The transportation benefit may also be paid when a Veteran\u2019s death occurs within a State on or after January 5, 2023, the place of burial is in any State, and at the time of death the Veteran\u2019s remains are unclaimed OR the Veteran was in receipt of disability compensation, military retired pay in lieu of disability compensation, or VA pension. When a Veteran is buried in a national or covered Veterans\u2019 cemetery, the cost to transport a Veteran\u2019s remains may be paid if death was due to service-connected disability, at the time of death the Veteran was in receipt of or was entitled to receive disability compensation but for the receipt of military retired pay or non-service-connected disability pension, or the Veteran\u2019s remains are unclaimed. The cost of transporting the remains from place of death for burial in a national cemetery or a covered Veterans\u2019 cemetery shall not exceed the cost of transportation to the national cemetery in which space is available nearest the Veteran's last place of residence.  A headstone or marker may be authorized. If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2021, the maximum headstone or marker allowance is $231. Also, an American flag to drape the casket of a Veteran may be provided.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/31f7d223abe9403794583c73a4dd39dc/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=834b1f1a00a42c38f50234076316a790","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=64.101","top_agency_name":"Department of Veterans Affairs","sub_agency_name":"Veterans Benefits Administration","assistance_types":["Intrastate"],"beneficiary_types":["Individual/Family"],"applicant_types":["Individual/Family"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":307551086.0,"usa_spending_actual":859302883.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":351874266.0,"usa_spending_actual":790045157.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":362430493.0,"usa_spending_actual":476765100.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":859302883.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":790045157.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":476765100.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"FY 2016 estimates are 40,538 burial allowances and 497,644 burial flags"},{"year":"2017","description":": FY 2017 estimates are 41,867 burial allowances and 497,644 burial flags.
