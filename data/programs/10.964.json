{"id":"10.964","name":"Emergency Relief Program","popular_name":"ERP","objective":"ERP provides financial assistance to producers for losses to crops, trees, bushes, and vines due to wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought, and related conditions occurring in calendar years 2020 and 2021. Losses due to drought are only eligible for assistance if any area within the county in which the loss occurred was rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a D2 (severe drought) for eight consecutive weeks or a D3 (extreme drought) or higher level of drought intensity for any period of time during the calendar year. This program is authorized by the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (Pub. L. 117-43). ERP will be administered in two phases. Phase 1 uses a streamlined process with pre-filled application forms when the data needed to calculate a payment is already on file with FSA or USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency (RMA) as a result of the producer previously receiving a crop insurance indemnity under certain crop insurance policies or a payment through FSA\u2019s Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). Phase 2 uses a producer\u2019s decrease in allowable gross revenue as an approximation of a producer\u2019s crop losses due to qualifying disaster events, which reflects losses in both production and quality and captures a producer\u2019s loss regardless of whether the loss occurs before harvest or after harvest while the crop is in storage, further streamlining the delivery of assistance.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/2b712a9904874a1399ea2de8b0fc96b6/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=b4cbc752c2baf9695a138ba5c5b49404","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.964","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Intrastate"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Profit organization"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1426692000.0,"usa_spending_actual":1126590522.91},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":486239201.0,"usa_spending_actual":48082709.33},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":486159000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":343410765.24,"obligation":1126590522.91},{"x":"2024","outlay":2867764.28,"obligation":48082709.33},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2022","description":"FSA anticipates issuing approximately $9 billion in payments to eligible producers under ERP."},{"year":"2024","description":"Phase 1 and Phase 2 paid out $486,239,201 to 302,262 applicants."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Pub.
