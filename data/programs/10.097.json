{"id":"10.097","name":"Water-Saving Commodities Grant","popular_name":null,"objective":"Water-Savings Conservation Grants (WSCG) provide targeted financial assistance to help agricultural producers continue commodity production while also helping irrigation districts conserve water across Western States.  The overall objectives are to conserve the decreasing supply of irrigation water, increase the efficiency of water use, upgrade existing irrigation infrastructure, strengthen water security, supply and distribution, and reduce adverse impacts to producers. USDA will learn from the diversity of strategies used and identify additional opportunities to maintain and expand water-saving commodity production in the future.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/97c22f0dd8b54425933c45c471b77b63/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=3d65a7f419a99ab16cc56a520020c622","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.097","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Farmer/Rancher/Agriculture Producer"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","For-Profit Organization (Other than Small Business)","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Nonprofit with 501C3 IRS Status (Other than Institution of Higher Education)","Small business (less than 500 employees)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":400000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"15 U.S.C. &sect; 714c(b).","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/714"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"2 CFR Chapter IV","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
