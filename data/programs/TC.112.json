{"id":"TC.112","name":"Deductibility of charitable contributions to educational institutions","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow a deduction for personal expenditures. In contrast, the Tax Code provides taxpayers a deduction for contributions to nonprofit educational institutions that are similar to personal expenditures. Moreover, taxpayers who donate capital assets to educational institutions can deduct the asset\u2019s current value without being taxed on any appreciation in value. An individual\u2019s total charitable contribution generally may not exceed 50 percent (60 percent for tax years 2018 through 2025) of adjusted gross income; a corporation\u2019s total charitable contributions generally may not exceed 10 percent of pre-tax income.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":6230000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":9090000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":9310000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
