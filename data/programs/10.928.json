{"id":"10.928","name":"Emergency Watershed Protection Program - Floodplain Easements \u2013 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act ","popular_name":"EWPP-FPE Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act 2019","objective":"The Emergency Watershed Protection - Floodplain Easement Program (EWPP-FPE) provides an alternative measure to traditional EWPP recovery where it is determined that acquiring an easement in lieu of recovery measures is the more economical and prudent approach to reducing a threat to life or property (see 7 CFR Part 624). The easement must be restored to the extent practicable to the natural environment and may include both structural and nonstructural practices to restore the flood storage and flow, erosion control, and improve the practical management of the easement. Structures, including buildings, within the floodplain easement must be demolished and removed, or relocated outside the 100-year floodplain or dam breach inundation area.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/b2938f4239a843e99426bd950ae418ab/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=621244ed9b6da32b43db4d00af9563d8","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.928","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Natural Resources Conservation Service","assistance_types":["Interstate","Provision of Specialized Services"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Homeowner","Land/Property Owner","Local","Public nonprofit institution/organization","Sponsored organization","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Non-Government - General","Other public institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":10263968.0,"usa_spending_actual":323000.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4724548.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":3000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":139209.65,"obligation":323000.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2020","description":"Over 189,000 acres in 37 states have been enrolled in EWPP-FPE"},{"year":"2021","description":"Over 199,700 acres in 38 states have been enrolled in EWPP-FPE.
