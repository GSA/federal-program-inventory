{"id":"10.135","name":"Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage","popular_name":"Supplemental DMC","objective":"Supplemental Dairy Margin Coverage (Supplemental DMC) is a program enhancement to Dairy Margin Coverage which allows small and mid-size dairy operations the opportunity to establish a supplemental production history in addition to an already established production history.  By increasing the dairy operations production history through supplemental, will allow the dairy operation to cover a higher percentage of their milk production and marketing risks. DMC offers a protection plan which provides payments to dairy operations when the difference between the all-milk price and the average feed cost fall below a certain, producer selected, dollar amount. Producers will be eligible for a basic level of margin protection for a small administrative fee and be able to purchase higher coverage with a fee.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/6595a6a9b6d0436f8fb309dc193e1213/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=7e9a7c41534851debb60e9e72d73bda2","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=10.135","top_agency_name":"Department of Agriculture","sub_agency_name":"Farm Service Agency","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public","Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Minority group","Profit organization","Small business (less than 500 employees)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":88944908.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":1544292.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2023","description":"Provided risk management protection on the difference between the National All milk price and the National average of formula feed costs (the margin).\n\nDepending on the announced monthly margins, millions of indemnity payments were processed annually for participating SDMC producers."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"7 USC 9055-9057 U.S.C. &sect; .","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":0,"rules_regulations":"Regulations published in the Federal Register, 7 CFR Part 1430.
