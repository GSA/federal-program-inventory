{"id":"15.444","name":"Take Pride","popular_name":"Environmental Studies Program (ESP)","objective":"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) provides major economic and energy benefits on a national and local level to the taxpayers, states and the American Indian community. The BOEM oversees the exploration and development of oil, natural gas and other minerals and renewable energy alternatives on the Nation\u2019s outer continental shelf. BOEM continues to look for better ways to serve the American people and to ensure that the Nation receives the best value for its resources now and into the future. The program not only supports decisions made within the Department of Interior, but also provides coastal States and local governments with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore energy and mineral activities are conducted in a manner to protect both the human and natural environments. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) Section 1346 mandates the conduct of environmental and socioeconomic studies needed for the assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments which may be affected by oil and gas or other mineral development. OCSLA Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected States to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information, joint utilization of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore. The purpose of the Environmental Studies Program is to obtain the information needed for the assessment and the management of environmental impacts; to predict impacts on marine biota; and to monitor the human, marine, and coastal environments to provide time series and data trend information.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/55e81652216848ac8fb8bd751dabd8cc/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=41dfe00ffbf758e8db15c9670d8adec8","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.444","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Anyone/general public","Federal","Local","Native American Organizations","Scientist/Researchers","State"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":158650.09,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":250000.0,"usa_spending_actual":250000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":35416.86,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":12703.83,"obligation":250000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2020","description":"Not Applicable, this Program is not funded this fiscal year"},{"year":"2021","description":"Not Applicable, this Program is not funded this fiscal year"},{"year":"2022","description":"Not Applicable, estimated this Program is not funded this fiscal year"},{"year":"2023","description":"Capacity Building and Collaboration"},{"year":"2024","description":"Anticipate Future Award."},{"year":"2025","description":"Anticipate Future Award."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Under the Take Pride in America Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a74601-4608), to establish and maintain a public awareness campaign, in cooperation with public and private organizations and individuals, to instill in the public the importance of the appropriate use of, and appreciation for, Federal, state, and local natural and cultural resources.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"The Environmental Studies Program is described in 30 CFR Chapter II Subchapter B Subpart M-Studies.
