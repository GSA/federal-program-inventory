{"id":"15.236","name":"Environmental Quality and Protection","popular_name":null,"objective":"The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and its cooperative government and\nnongovernmental conservation partners, mitigate hazards to protect public\nhealth and safety, restore watersheds for resources, recreation, fish, wildlife and\ndomestic animals, and return lands to productive uses including, but not limited\nto, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and preservation of\nhistorical/cultural resources. Extractive industry and disposal activities of the\npast, including both underground and surface mining, have left degraded\nwatersheds on public lands throughout the western United States. Unreclaimed\nsites pose an environmental threat to groundwater, surface water and soil as\nwell as create a risk to the health and safety of public land users. Mitigation\nmeasures are implemented through core programs such as: 1). Abandoned Mine\nLands (AML) program, which addresses physical safety hazards and water\nquality through restoration of abandoned hard rock mines. and 2). Educational\noutreach about the potential dangers posed to the public and recreationists\nfrom AML sites.  The AML Program will contribute to the conservation and\nrestoration of approximately 30% of our lands and waters by the year 2030.\nAdditionally, this will help ensure that public land users are not at risk from the\ndangers of legacy mining activities.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/fd5e9469b2ec46c1981d6fa820b618d4/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=c539f9e374b73346b0d1f368146cf7d0","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.236","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Land Management","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Anyone/general public"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":8041821.0,"usa_spending_actual":7392627.03},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":5634490.0,"usa_spending_actual":5553384.01},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":5000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":5006596.76,"obligation":6460823.73},{"x":"2024","outlay":458613.78,"obligation":1173929.78},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"Ongoing Utah and Colorado Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program (AMRP), reclaiming abandoned mine openings and lands affected by past mining activities.
