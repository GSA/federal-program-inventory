In contrast, when a gift of appreciated asset is made under current law, the donor\u2019s basis in the transferred property (the cost that was incurred when the transferred property was first acquired) carries over to the donee. The carryover of the donor\u2019s basis allows a continued deferral of unrealized capital gains.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":4590000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":4830000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":5310000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
