{"id":"81.302","name":"Inertial Confinement Fusion Program University Assistance","popular_name":"Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)","objective":"The goal of the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program is to create nuclear weapons relevant conditions in the laboratory without the need to return to underground nuclear testing. The objectives of this assistance listing are: (1) To support the U.S. scientific community in ICF and High Energy Density (HED) science through university involvement in areas of fundamental science and technology relevant to stockpile stewardship; (2) to promote and sustain scientific interactions between the academic community and scientists at the NNSA laboratories; (3) to train scientists in specific areas of long-term research relevant to stockpile stewardship; (4) to support and enable access to university-based ICF research facilities, and increase the availability of unique experimental facilities sited at NNSA's laboratories to the academic community, particularly for collaborations in areas of relevance to stockpile stewardship; and (5) to develop and maintain a long-term recruiting pipeline to NNSA's laboratories by increasing the visibility of NNSA's ICF program\u2019s scientific activities to the U.S. faculty and student communities.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/a8246ac01a3447da9839e6e303aa91d4/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=0ad917fb4f58f42cfe49d5196dab41d2","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=81.302","top_agency_name":"Department of Energy","sub_agency_name":null,"assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federal","Other public institution/organization","Scientist/Researchers"],"applicant_types":["Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":994000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":".","url":null},{"text":"Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977, 31.
