{"id":"TC.008","name":"Credit for increasing research activities","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would uniformly tax all returns to investments and not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an R&E credit of up to 20 percent of qualified research expenditures in excess of a base amount. The base amount of the credit is generally determined by multiplying a \u201cfixed-base percentage\u201d by the average amount of the company\u2019s gross receipts for the prior four years. The taxpayer\u2019s fixed base percentage generally is the ratio of its research expenses to gross receipts for 1984 through 1988. Taxpayers can elect the alternative simplified credit regime, which equals 14 percent of qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - General Science, Space, and Technology"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":28220000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":30040000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":31890000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
