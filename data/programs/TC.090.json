{"id":"TC.090","name":"Exclusion of reimbursed employee parking expenses","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, would be included in taxable income. Dedicated payments and in-kind benefits represent accretions to wealth that do not differ materially from cash wages. In contrast, the Tax Code allows an exclusion from taxable income for employee parking expenses that are paid for by the employer or that are received by the employee in lieu of wages. In 2024, the maximum amount of the parking exclusion is $315 per month. The tax expenditure estimate does not include any subsidy provided through employer-owned parking facilities. However, beginning in 2018, parking expenses are no longer deductible to employers.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Transportation"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1827000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":1950000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":2040000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
