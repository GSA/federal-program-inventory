{"id":"16.036","name":"Comprehensive Forensic DNA Analysis Grant Program","popular_name":"Cold Cases","objective":"The goals of this comprehensive program are to assist eligible states and units of local government to collect, process, and increase capacity to process DNA evidence for entry into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) to reduce DNA processing backlogs, improve the timeliness of testing, and increase prosecution of violent cold case crimes in which suspects have been identified through DNA evidence.\n\nThe primary objective is to increase the number of CODIS-eligible samples analyzed in eligible laboratories and to reduce DNA testing turnaround times for CODIS entry. \n\nAdditional objectives aim to:\n\u2022\tEnsure that DNA testing and analysis of samples from crimes are carried out in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\tIncrease the capacity of state and local prosecuting agencies to address the backlog of violent crime cases in which suspects have been identified through DNA evidence.  \n\n\nDNA Capacity Enhancement for Backlog Reduction (CEBR) Program\nPM 1: Number of DNA profile uploads into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)  \n\nPM 2: Number of cases completed since the beginning of the grant period.  \n\n\nProsecuting Cold Cases Using DNA (Cold Cases) Program\nPerformance Measure 1: Violent cold cases investigations that resulted in an indictment or charging decision; and, \n\nPerformance Measure 2: Violent cold cases that resulted in suspect identification.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/7aff07c09aa14cfc94e50b05fbea0990/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=0d0a106c656fe753294238b2997bee80","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.036","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Office of Justice Programs","assistance_types":["Government - General","Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Government - General"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":116000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":105000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":105366613.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":110000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":100320.05}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":2768456.66,"obligation":105366613.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":180418.0}],"results":[{"year":"2022","description":"Please visit https://bja.ojp.gov/program/prosecuting-cold-cases-using-dna/grantees"},{"year":"2023","description":"See BJA\u2019s Forensics Training and Technical Assistance (Forensics TTA) Program\u2019s DNA CEBR Program Website at https://www.forensicstta.org/programs/dna-capacity-enhancement-backlog-reduction-cebr-program/  and Cold Cases Program Website at https://www.forensicstta.org/programs/prosecuting-cold-cases-using-dna-cold-program/"},{"year":"2024","description":"See BJA\u2019s Forensics Training and Technical Assistance (Forensics TTA) Program\u2019s DNA CEBR Program Website at https://www.forensicstta.org/programs/dna-capacity-enhancement-backlog-reduction-cebr-program/ and Cold Cases Program Website at https://www.forensicstta.org/programs/prosecuting-cold-cases-using-dna-cold-program/ \n\n \n\nRecent data shows that the CEBR Program is responsible for more than 500 CODIS hits per week.
