{"id":"15.408","name":"Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Renewable Energy ","popular_name":"Renewable Energy Program","objective":"The Renewable Energy Program oversees the leasing of areas on the outer continental shelf for development of renewable energy facilities.  The program not only supports decisions made within the Department of the Interior, but also provides coastal states and local governments with the information necessary to ensure that all stages of offshore renewable energy projects are conducted in a manner to protect both the human and natural environments.  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected states to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing information, joint utilization of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out applicable Federal and state laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/afdb080ec7fc457a9728f650f8bac245/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=facb732547f9b85386ca63911f63dd22","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.408","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement","assistance_types":["Non-Government - General"],"beneficiary_types":["Federal","Local","Native American Organizations","Scientist/Researchers","State","U.S. Citizen"],"applicant_types":["Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-15013.96},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-1044.63},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2017","description":"Field surveys for marine mammals No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2018","description":"Whale surveys"},{"year":"2019","description":"No Current Data Available."},{"year":"2020","description":"Fish telemetry and Neuston surveys."},{"year":"2021","description":"Fish telemetry and Neuston surveys"},{"year":"2022","description":"Aerial surveys off Massachusetts"},{"year":"2023","description":"Continuation of the aerial surveys off Massachusetts"},{"year":"2024","description":"No Current Data Available"},{"year":"2025","description":"No Current Data Available"}],"authorizations":[{"text":"43 U.S.C. 1337; 43 U.S.C. 1345 (e); 43 U.S.C. 1346.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Information about plan requirements can be found in 30 CFR Part 585.","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
