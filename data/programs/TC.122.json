{"id":"TC.122","name":"Exclusion of employee meals and lodging (other than military)","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, all compensation, including dedicated payments and in-kind benefits, should be included in taxable income. Furthermore, all compensation would generally be deductible by the employer. In contrast, under current law employer-provided meals and lodging are excluded from an employee\u2019s gross income. Additionally, beginning in 2018, employers are allowed a deduction for only 50 percent of the expenses of employer-provided meals, except that in 2021 and 2022, employers are eligible for a full deduction on restaurant meals provided to employees. Employer-provided lodging is fully deductible by the employer, in general.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":7530000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":6690000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":6830000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
