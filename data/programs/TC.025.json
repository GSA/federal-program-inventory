{"id":"TC.025","name":"Zero-emission nuclear power production credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits or deductions for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investmentlike activities. In contrast, the Tax Code allows a tax credit per unit of electricity produced at a nuclear facility placed in service before enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is based on the gross receipts of the facility, the electricity produced, any other Federal/State/local zero-emissions credits or grants received, and whether the facility adopts certain labor standards.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":2550000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":1130000000.0,"forgone_revenue":3160000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
