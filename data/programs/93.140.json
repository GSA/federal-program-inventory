{"id":"93.140","name":"Intramural Research Training Award","popular_name":"IRTA","objective":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) IRTA Traineeships/Fellowships are established for the principal benefit of the participants and to provide opportunities for developmental training and practical research experience in a variety of disciplines related to biomedical research, medical library research, and related fields. The IRTA components are: 1) Postdoctoral IRTA - designed to provide advanced practical research experience to physicians and other doctoral researchers who are at the beginning stages of their professional research careers; 2) Predoctoral IRTA - designed to provide practical research training and experience to students, by supplementing academic course work and/or encouraging pursuit of professional careers in biomedical research to students enrolled in doctoral degree programs in biomedical sciences;  3) Postbaccalaureate IRTA - designed to provide recent college graduates, particularly minorities, women, and persons with disabilities, an opportunity to postpone application to graduate or medical school and to provide a means to introduce individuals early in their careers to research, encourage their pursuit of professional careers in biomedical research, and allow additional time to pursue successful application to either graduate or medical school programs; and 4) Student IRTA - designed to provide a developmental training experience to promising high school, undergraduate, and graduate or professional students who have expressed a strong interest in or are studying disciplines related to biomedical sciences.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/1e20139d1ab64bdfa6721eaed0469927/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=624ea372dea56da0aec59e6692737218","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.140","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"National Institutes of Health","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":["Scientist/Researchers"],"applicant_types":["Individual/Family"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":164421366.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":172988626.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":181638057.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"IV, 409, Health Professionals Education Partnerships Act. 42 U.S.C. &sect; 282(b)(13).","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/42/282"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":0,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
