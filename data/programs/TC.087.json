{"id":"TC.087","name":"Advanced manufacturing investment credit","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system would not allow credits for particular activities, investments, or industries. Instead, it generally would seek to tax uniformly all returns from investment-like activities. However, the Tax Code provides credits for investments in semiconductor manufacturing equipment within the United States. The credit is 25 percent for qualified property placed into service after December 31, 2022. Construction on a qualified facility must begin by December 31, 2025. Owners of facilities that qualify for the advanced manufacturing investment credit may elect to treat investment credits as a payment of tax equal to the amount of the credit.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":190000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":220000000.0,"forgone_revenue":3220000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":1130000000.0,"forgone_revenue":2680000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
