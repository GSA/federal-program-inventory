{"id":"42.013","name":"Of the People: Community Collections Grants","popular_name":"AFC-Mellon","objective":"The Library of Congress seeks to award grants to support contemporary cultural documentation focusing on the culture and traditions of diverse, often underrepresented communities in the United States today. These projects will result in archival collections preserved at the American Folklife Center and made accessible through the Library of Congress\u2019 web site. The major goals of this grant program are to enable communities to document their cultural traditions, practices, and experiences from their own perspectives, while enhancing the Library\u2019s holdings with materials featuring creativity and knowledge found at the local level. As such, successful proposals will come from applicants within or closely affiliated with the community they propose to document.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/4b33a7b9a61c479b949f1ca2792669bb/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=ed79407bea857c6abfa451de18836c5b","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=42.013","top_agency_name":"Library of Congress","sub_agency_name":"Library of Congress","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Individual/Family","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State","U.S. Territories and possessions","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"American Folklife Preservation: Congressional declaration of findings and purpose U.S.C. &sect; 20 USC \u00a7 2101.","url":null},{"text":"Library of Congress: Disbursement of gifts, etc., to Library U.S.C. &sect; 2 USC 160.","url":null}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
