{"id":"97.107","name":"National Incident Management System (NIMS)","popular_name":null,"objective":"The purpose of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National incident Management System (NIMS) cooperative agreement is to support Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which is a Congressionally ratified mutual aid compact. (Pub. L. No. 104-321). The \u201cpurpose of the compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into the compact in managing any emergency disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.\u201d See id., Section 1 Congressional Intent, Article 1, Purpose and Authorities.   EMAC signatories include all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Id. The federal government doctrinally and financially supports EMAC but does not manage it. EMAC\u2019s unique relationships with states, regions, territories, and Federal organizations, such as FEMA and the National Guard Bureau, enable it to move a wide variety of resources to stabilize community lifelines immediately after an incident. Among other things, EMAC assists states in sending personnel, equipment, and commodities to support disaster relief efforts in other states. \n\nThe FY 2023 NIMS cooperative agreement aids EMAC\u2019s development and maintenance of a consistent system for the request, dispatch, use, and return of resources necessary to support local capabilities during incident response and recovery operations. The development of a multi-jurisdictional, interstate regional mechanism for coordinating incident management and obtaining assistance to stabilize community lifelines immediately during large-scale, complex, or catastrophic incidents will help to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities essential to achieving the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient nation.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/8840f19d0d5d4bfb908574dc2b4516e9/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=c1718cbaef6ace1e8c2d2f8ed6faa224","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=97.107","top_agency_name":"Department of Homeland Security","sub_agency_name":"Federal Emergency Management Agency","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization","State","U.S. Territories"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Local (includes State-designated Indian Tribes, excludes institutions of higher education and hospitals","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State (includes District of Columbia, public institutions of higher education and hospitals)","U.S. Territories and possessions (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":2000000.0},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":2000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":2250000.0},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":1999943.96,"obligation":2000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":980005.62,"obligation":2250000.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"\u2022 Support for the refinement of NIMS and its national roll-out as directed by FEMA\r\n\u2022 Provide education and training to states on preparing for and deploying through EMAC.\r\n\u2022 Development, enhancement, and maintenance of EMAC\u2019s information management systems for the availability, request, dispatch, use, tracking, and return of resources in all states during all-hazard incidents requiring mutual aid.
