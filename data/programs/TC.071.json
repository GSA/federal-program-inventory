{"id":"TC.071","name":"Premiums for mortgage insurance deductible as interest","popular_name":null,"objective":"Under the baseline tax system, expenses incurred in earning income would be deductible, but such expenses would not be deductible when the income or the return on an investment is not taxed. Because imputed rental income is not subject to tax, mortgage insurance premiums do not represent expenses incurred in earning income. In contrast, the Tax Code allows mortgage insurance premiums to be treated as deductible mortgage interest expenses. The provision applies to premiums paid in 2021.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Commerce and Housing"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":0.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
