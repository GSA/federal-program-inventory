It was reported in 2023 that the Borlaug Fellowship Program contributed to research on a high-yield rice variety resistant to disease and humid conditions, leading to the development of a reliable molecular toolbox for simultaneous analysis of multiple functional genes in rice and superior grain quality. The collaboration remains ongoing and will seek to identify genes associated with an increased tolerance to dry periods used in the alternative wetting and drying technique, which allows for less water usage and greenhouse gas emissions in the rice growing process."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"7 U.S.C. &sect; 3319j.","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/7/3319"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"","improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
