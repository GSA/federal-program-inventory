Funds were available to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, for necessary expenses to reimburse, through grants or other mechanisms, eligible health care providers for health care-related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.  Eligible providers of health care, services, and support received Provider Relief Fund payments for health care-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to coronavirus.\n\nIn addition to the Provider Relief Fund, $8.5 billion was appropriated as part of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021 for payments to rural providers or suppliers for health care-related expenses and lost revenues attributable to coronavirus.\n\nWith the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and related rescission of program funds, HRSA will not obligate additional funds for payments under the Provider Relief Fund or the American Rescue Plan Rural Distribution. Per the Terms and Conditions of each Program, all reporting and auditing requirements will continue without disruption.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/e5be6c71fbd048b7922afed92dd92ed4/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=819d41dcd44c38a23e8fbd80fadfcdc1","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.498","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Health Resources and Services Administration","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":["Specialized group (e.g. health professionals, students, veterans)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":291947844.0,"usa_spending_actual":194529859.36},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-207837548.12},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":0.0,"usa_spending_actual":-48995442.73}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[{"year":"2023","description":"HRSA began distributing billions of dollars of CARES Act funding fourteen days after the legislation passed.\n\nHRSA DPI paid out over 796,106 general and targeted Provider Relief Fund (PRF) payments to over 421,000 providers at approximately !135.2 billion, and American Rescue Plan Rural payments to over 47,000 providers at approximately $8.3 billion.
