{"id":"16.526","name":"OVW Technical Assistance Initiative","popular_name":"TA Program","objective":"To provide communities with critical resources that help them forge partnerships across agencies and disciplines to respond effectively to violent crimes against women.  OVW's Technical Assistance Program was created to provide grantees with the expertise and support they need to develop and implement successful local projects, increase victim safety, and bolster offender accountability. Grantees participate in educational initiatives, conferences, peer-to- peer consultations, and targeted assistance that allow them to learn from experts and one another about how to overcome obstacles and incorporate promising practices in their efforts to address violence against women.  In addition, the Technical Assistance Program focuses on building the capacity of national criminal justice and victim advocacy organizations to effectively address violent crimes against women and examine issues of special interest to OVW and its constituents.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/8426524e8be44c9bb5fc080265007ce1/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=6c915cb6d0edf527a6bd282bf1a2be9b","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=16.526","top_agency_name":"Department of Justice","sub_agency_name":"Boards and Divisions Offices","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Other private institution/organization","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization","Public nonprofit institution/organization"],"applicant_types":["Other private institutions/organizations","Other public institution/organization","Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)"],"categories":["Law, Justice, and Legal Services - Law Enforcement Support"],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":67983800.0,"usa_spending_actual":65054992.85},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":43378861.0,"usa_spending_actual":38757795.38},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":43378861.0,"usa_spending_actual":0.0}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":25044547.32,"obligation":65383800.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":3302232.46,"obligation":41167450.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0}],"results":[],"authorizations":[{"text":"34 U.S.C. &sect; 12291(b)(11).","url":"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/34/12291"}],"program_type":"assistance_listing","is_subpart_f":1,"rules_regulations":"Program notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs) can be found at https://www.justice.gov/ovw/open-notices-of-funding-opportunities.
