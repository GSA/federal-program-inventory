{"id":"TC.017","name":"Capital gains treatment of royalties on coal","popular_name":null,"objective":"The baseline tax system generally would tax all income under the regular tax rate schedule. It would not allow preferentially low tax rates to apply to certain types or sources of income. Current law allows capital gains realized by individuals to be taxed at a preferentially low rate that is no higher than 20 percent (plus the 3.8 percent surtax). Certain sales of coal under royalty contracts qualify for taxation as capital gains rather than ordinary income.","sam_url":null,"usaspending_url":null,"grants_url":null,"top_agency_name":"Department of the Treasury","sub_agency_name":"Internal Revenue Service (IRS)","assistance_types":["Tax Expenditures"],"beneficiary_types":[],"applicant_types":[],"categories":["Tax Expenditures - Energy"],"obligations":null,"other_program_spending":[{"x":"2023","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":50000000.0},{"x":"2024","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":50000000.0},{"x":"2025","outlays":0.0,"forgone_revenue":50000000.0}],"outlays":null,"results":[],"authorizations":[],"program_type":"tax_expenditure","is_subpart_f":null,"rules_regulations":null,"improper_payments":[],"gwo":null,"pons":[]}
