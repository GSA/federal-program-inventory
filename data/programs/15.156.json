The program also enables tribal participation in ocean and coastal planning.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/13e8deb854dc40e494b20c2e6c74d7c3/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=5d71047099f21455315d4270bc5bd0cf","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=15.156","top_agency_name":"Department of the Interior","sub_agency_name":"Bureau of Indian Education","assistance_types":["Interstate"],"beneficiary_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments"],"applicant_types":["Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments","Native American Organizations (includes Indian groups, cooperatives, corporations, partnerships, associations)"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":4979630.0,"usa_spending_actual":19439130.39},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":63412412.0,"usa_spending_actual":64197003.55},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":91821000.0,"usa_spending_actual":80172014.09}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":15302384.75,"obligation":19713312.59},{"x":"2024","outlay":34898841.62,"obligation":70809480.0},{"x":"2025","outlay":10206736.0,"obligation":66742439.2}],"results":[{"year":"2020","description":"The Indian Affairs fulfilled its program objectives by awarding approximately 160 Federal Assistance Awards and Grants in FY2020."},{"year":"2021","description":"IA issued 139 new awards and modifications to existing awards to 97 recipients."},{"year":"2022","description":"Awards 6 grants to entities to complete the goals and objectives of the program."},{"year":"2024","description":"This award funded 253 programs for ocean and coastal management planning, cooperative landscape conservation, climate resilience and other environmental related programs."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"Snyder Act of 1921, as amended, 25 U.S.C.  \u00a7 13.
