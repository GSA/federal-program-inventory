These numbers have further increased this year: now more than 5000 data layers, 32 responses, and an astonishing 1191 products through October 2020 alone. The incredible growth (over three-fold compared to the previous year) in the number of products was due to many factors, chief among which were support for COVID-19, a record-breaking hurricane season, and increased partnerships with domestic, national, regional, and international agencies involved in disaster relief operations.\nPDC\u2019s steady and strong growth over the past decade has been largely fueled by increased visibility and credibility resulting from meaningful engagements with the Combatant Commands (CCDM) in almost all geographies, as well as strengthened existing and forged new\npartnerships at home and abroad. PDC is now an integral part of planning, operational readiness, risk reduction, and disaster response for many CCDMs and domestic and international partner agencies, rightfully recognized as a preferred and credible partner in science- and evidence-based disaster reduction and related decision-making processes.\nIn 2020, PDC's DisasterAWARE supports DoD's RAPIDS as well as EMOPS (supporting the Department's and its partner's DSCA and HA/DR missions, U.S. Interagency, U.S state and local  emergency managers, the international community, and partner nations), Disaster Alert (nearly 2M public users), as well as a host of national and regional systems in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre (AHA Centre).  The system has also been adopted by the private sector as \"DisasterAWARE Enterprise.\"."},{"year":"2021","description":"PDC's healthy growth has also been augmented and aided by \"externally-funded\" projects - those funded outside of the CA base funding.  While PDC's DisasterAWARE flagship product continues to attract many, its risk assessment and analytical capabilities are playing an ever-increasing role in informed decision-making for CCDMs and all stakeholders.  PDC's partnership with CCDMs to develop analytical products addressing \"Women, Peace, and Security,\" \"Green-White\" networks to help identify and develop strategies against malice actors, and \"National Fragility\" index to help quantify changing landscapes of national security and stability are all but a few examples of PDC's maturing Global Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (RVA) program, aided by CCDM's partnerships in supporting and funding National Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA) projects around the globe."},{"year":"2023","description":"1) Provided disaster management technology, tools, and services through DisasterAWARE Pro, a powerful and reliable early warning and multi-hazard monitoring platform; Disaster Alert, a free, public application of DisasterAWARE that provides individuals, families, and their loved ones with the information they need to stay safe anywhere in the world; and RAPIDS, designed for DoD to provide global situational awareness for disaster risk reduction and critical information supporting Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) missions. \n2) Incorporated new hazard sources for NASA Global Floods through scaled architecture and Canada Met into DisasterAWARE Pro.\n3) Provided automated hazard monitoring for 19,877 hazard events and produced 136,783 automated products. 4) Delivered decision support products, including impacts and needs assessments during major disaster response operations for Hurricanes Fiona, Ian, Lisa and Nicole. \n5) Expanded National Disaster Preparedness Baseline Assessment (NDPBA) Support to Colombia (2022-2023), Eastern Caribbean (2022-2023), Suriname (2023-2024), and Ecuador (2023-2024).\n6) Co-chaired the United Nation\u2019s Global Information Management Working Group for GIS (IMWG) with UNICEF to improve inclusion and accessibility to GIS technology to all partners in the humanitarian and development space (traditional and non-traditional)."}],"authorizations":[{"text":"DoD appropriations Act of FY2000 and 10 USC 2358, Sec. 8128 from P.L. 106-79, Sec. 8128 from P.L. 106-79 (DoD appropriations Act of\nFY2000).","url":null},{"text":"Pub.
