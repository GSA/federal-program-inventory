{"id":"93.583","name":"Refugee and Entrant Assistance Wilson/Fish Program","popular_name":"Wilson-Fish -TANF Coordination Program","objective":"The objective of the Wilson Fish demonstration program is to develop innovative alternatives projects to support refugee resettlement. The current alternative project, the Wilson-Fish Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Coordination Program, targets refugee families with children under the age of 18 and who are TANF-eligible. This program provides funds for the development and implementation of innovative approaches throughout a state to facilitate access to relevant, customized, and culturally and linguistically appropriate integrated services and resources. Funds are also used to develop and provide in-person and remote services and/or resources that enhance or complement programming serving TANF-eligible refugees to address unmet needs. These projects require coordination between recipients and the state TANF office. The program is focused on refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months, which is the time they can receive interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. The Wilson-Fish TANF Coordination Program (FY 2020 \u2013 FY 2025) does not include cash assistance or medical services.","sam_url":"https://sam.gov/fal/83f0b256044b46fe881112cb54615992/view","usaspending_url":"https://www.usaspending.gov/search/?hash=55dd265f1436feb396e429f16ac45e28","grants_url":"https://grants.gov/search-grants?cfda=93.583","top_agency_name":"Department of Health and Human Services","sub_agency_name":"Administration for Children and Families","assistance_types":["Project Grants"],"beneficiary_types":["Refugee/Alien"],"applicant_types":["Private nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","Public nonprofit institution/organization (includes institutions of higher education and hospitals)","State"],"categories":[],"obligations":[{"x":"2023","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":26183318.0,"usa_spending_actual":26134941.66},{"x":"2024","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":12961214.0,"usa_spending_actual":12943256.6},{"x":"2025","sam_estimate":0.0,"sam_actual":35000000.0,"usa_spending_actual":-17146652.34}],"other_program_spending":null,"outlays":[{"x":"2023","outlay":0.0,"obligation":0.0},{"x":"2024","outlay":14194464.15,"obligation":-17957.4},{"x":"2025","outlay":471981300.74,"obligation":-17146652.34}],"results":[{"year":"2016","description":"In FY 2016, it is expected that 13 Awards will be made.
